# One name, rewritten everywhere it is still read: implementation

The companion to [`2026-09-05-agent-rename.md`](2026-09-05-agent-rename.md),
one section per milestone, appended in the change that ticks the
milestone. It records deviations from the plan, resolutions of anything
the plan left open, and discoveries; a milestone with no deviations says
so explicitly.

## M1: one transaction, three schemas

PR #415.

### What landed

In the order the commits tell it: the type and its status, the memory
half, the record half, the verb that spans them, and the suite that pins
the whole of it before anything can reach it.

- **`config/loader.py` gains `AgentRenameConflictError`,** beside
  `DeviceAlreadyBoundError`, which is the same kind of fact about the
  world rather than about the request. `config/api.py`'s
  `REFUSAL_STATUS` gains its 409 row in the same commit, so the type and
  the code it means never exist apart, and the existing ordinal comments
  in that table were renumbered by one where the new row landed among
  them. One class for all three destination states, because what a
  caller does about them is the same.
- **`memory/store.py` gains `rename_owner(connection, scope, old, new)
  -> int`,** with three fixed sentences beside `PURGE_FAILED` and
  `PURGE_BUSY`: the occupied destination, the storage refusal and the
  retryable one. It takes the memory chain's advisory lock as its first
  statement, checks whether anything is filed under the destination,
  raises the typed conflict if so, and updates otherwise. Held rows move
  with the active ones, because a held fact carries `owner` like any
  other and a restore after the rename has to find it.
- **`conversations/store.py` gains `rename_agent(connection, old, new)
  -> int`,** the same shape with the record chain's lock and its own
  three sentences, addressing `conversations.agent` and nothing else.
  The module also gains `Connection`, `update` and `take_the_chain_lock`
  to its imports; nothing else in it moved.
- **`config/store.py` gains `ConfigStore.rename_agent(old, new) ->
  Renamed`,** which runs the four phases every write here runs and then
  crosses into the two foreign schemas in ascending key order. Beside it
  landed `Renamed` (the two names, the MACs whose bindings moved,
  whether the default agent moved, and the two row counts), `_Renaming`
  and `_stage_rename` (the staging pass, which moves the agent entry,
  rewrites every position of every binding that names it and moves the
  default agent, all in the candidate state `check_references` is then
  asked about once), `_rename_agent_row` (an UPDATE of the primary key
  rather than a delete and an insert, so the body and any column this
  table gains later travel with the row), and the module's two own
  refusals, `AGENT_EXISTS` and `SAME_NAME`.
- **`tests/unit/test_agent_rename.py`,** 24 cases: the sentinel sweep
  and its converse, the result type, the operator-vocabulary assertions,
  the held fact, the inventory pin, the seven refusals one case per
  state, the mapping pin, atomicity from the last statement,
  reversibility as a byte-identical round trip and again with a stranger
  present, one competing-write pin per store that checks a destination,
  and the statement-order pin those three cannot make (see the review
  round below).
- **`tests/unit/test_memory_store.py`** gains five direct cases for
  `rename_owner`: both areas move, the other scope is left alone, an
  occupied destination is refused and moves nothing, an owner holding
  nothing moves nothing, and a rename on a caller's connection belongs
  to that caller's transaction.
- **`tests/unit/test_memory_lifecycle.py`** gains the rename as the
  third path of the lock-order walk, `[1, 2, 3]`, and its `keys_taken`
  fixture now patches the record store's own reference to
  `take_the_chain_lock` alongside `db`'s and the memory store's.

### Deviations from the plan

Three, all of them placement or wording rather than behavior, and each
forced by something the plan itself states elsewhere.

1. **The collision sentences do not live in `config/store.py`.** The
   closed-set section says "each is one fixed sentence in
   `config/store.py` beside the sentences the other writes use", which
   was written before the sol review's finding 4 moved each destination
   check into the store that owns the rows. After that amendment the
   memory and record sentences are raised inside `memory/store.py` and
   `conversations/store.py`, and they cannot be read from
   `config/store.py`: that module imports both stores, so an import back
   would close a cycle the plan's own import note rules out. So each
   store owns the sentence for the destination it checks, and
   `config/store.py` owns the two states it can be in itself, the agent
   that already exists and the name that is already this agent's. The
   plan's later text ("raising the typed conflict through each store's
   classifier") is what was implemented.

2. **`rename_owner` sits beside `purge`, not beside `erase_facts`.** The
   module layout says "beside `erase_facts` which it mirrors", and the
   same bullet says "one statement under the chain's lock", which finding
   4 also superseded: it is two statements, and its shape is `purge`'s
   rather than `erase_facts`'s. `erase_facts` lives under the operator's
   door block, whose header states that its functions run on a
   connection a route opened for one request; this one runs inside
   another store's transaction. So it landed immediately after `purge`,
   with its docstring saying that its signature follows `erase_facts`'s.

3. **The old name is stripped but not checked for addressability.** The
   plan's refusal table applies `_identifier`/`_check_addressable` to
   the new name and says nothing about the old one, and the closed set
   has no state for an old name that is malformed. Running the
   addressability check on the source would have added an eighth state
   and would have made a legacy row less reachable than it is today, so
   the source is stripped (because every path here strips first) and
   then looked up; a source that is absent, blank included, meets
   `NO_SUCH_AGENT`.

### Discoveries

- **The domain half needs no delete-and-insert.** `db.schema.agents` is
  `(name, body)` and carries no `secrets` column, so the row moves under
  an UPDATE of its primary key. That is strictly better than the
  rewrite the plan's phases imply: it preserves the body byte for byte
  and it preserves any column the table gains later, which is what makes
  the reversibility pin's byte-identical claim hold without listing
  columns anywhere.

- **The sweep's recorded set is five pairs, and one of them is only
  there because the fixture puts it there.** `sessions.agent`,
  `sessions.agents`, `turns.agent`, `turns.legs` and `events.fields`.
  The last two exist because the fixture writes a split reply's legs and
  an event carrying the agent in its fields; nothing in a plain recorded
  turn puts an agent name inside JSON, so a fixture without them would
  have covered two fewer places while looking identical. That is the
  bound the plan states, met in practice on the first fixture.

- **A competing-write pin has to assert the queueing, not the final
  state.** With the chain lock removed from `rename_owner`, the
  competing writer commits between the check and the update and the
  final rows are the same as with the lock: the destination ends up
  holding both the moved rows and the intruder either way. What differs
  is only whether the second writer was made to wait, so each pin asks
  `pg_locks` whether that writer is really parked on the chain's key
  while the rename is between its two statements. Verified to bite:
  removing `take_the_chain_lock` from `rename_owner` fails the memory
  pin on `writer.queued`, removing it from the record's `rename_agent`
  fails the record pin the same way, and both were restored.

- **The sweep bites in both directions.** Verified by mutation:
  replacing the memory crossing with `facts = 0` leaves
  `("facts", "owner")` carrying the sentinel and fails the equality;
  adding an UPDATE of `turns.agent` to the record half takes
  `("turns", "agent")` out of the answer and fails it the other way.
  Both mutations were reverted.

- **A `begin` listener cannot see a connection before it blocks.**
  Naming the competing writer's backend needs its pid recorded before
  the chain's lock is asked for, and a second `begin` handler registered
  with `insert=True` did not run in front of the write engine's own: the
  pid arrived only once the lock had been granted, which is exactly when
  a blocked writer stops being blocked. The `connect` event is strictly
  earlier than any transaction and answers, which is what the pins use.

### The review round

Backend codex, model `gpt-5.6-sol`, against PR #415: 2 P2 and 1 P3,
mergeable after the fixes. All three are fixed on the branch, in one
commit each.

1. **P2: the competing-write pins did not prove the lock behavior they
   claimed.** Two holes, and both were real. The waiter predicate
   counted ANY ungranted waiter on the chain key, and this lane runs its
   files across worker processes against one instance, so a suite next
   door writing to the same chain would have satisfied it; and each pin
   releases its writer at the statement that WRITES, which is after the
   destination check, so all three would still have passed with a
   chain's lock taken between the check and the update rather than
   before both. Fixed as prescribed: each competitor now runs on an
   engine of its own whose backend pid is recorded on `connect`, and the
   predicate requires that exact pid; and a new case asserts the
   execution order directly, off `before_cursor_execute`, each chain's
   lock before the first statement naming that chain's table, with the
   ascending order read from the same list. Verified by moving
   `take_the_chain_lock` below the destination SELECT in both helpers:
   the three competing-write pins stayed green, which is the finding
   reproduced, and the order assertion failed on each half in turn
   (`assert 10 < 9` for the record chain, `assert 13 < 12` for the
   memory chain). Both mutations were reverted, and the earlier
   lock-removal mutation was re-run against the pid-precise predicate to
   confirm it still bites.

2. **P2: the memory collision named the listing that would not answer.**
   `memory list agent` is who is remembering anything and
   `memory list agent <name>` is what one of them remembers, the same
   words one level apart, and the refusal told a caller to read what is
   stored under the destination name with the first. The sentence now
   names the second. The `<name>` is a placeholder rather than a value:
   the no-echo rule the sentence itself states is unchanged, and the
   census manifest moved with it through its own module.

3. **P3: the two spellings of the PR number disagreed.** The plan's
   milestone tick said PR #415 and this document's header still said
   PR TBD. It says #415.

### Open questions the plan left, and what M1 answers

None. M1 carries no open question of its own; the plan's own questions
were resolved before it, and the in-flight protocol, the route, the
boundary sentence and the verb are M2 to M4.

### Verification

Re-run after the review round's fixes, which is where these numbers are
from.

- `uv run ruff check .`: clean.
- `uv run pytest tests/unit -q -n auto --dist loadfile`: 5756 passed,
  19 skipped. The command-spellings manifest stales on every change to a
  tracked file and is regenerated through its own module.
- `uv run pytest tests/integration -q`: 243 passed.
- `scripts/check_doc_links.py .`: 206 files, 0 failures.
- The generated-document drift checks: all seven current, none
  regenerated. M1 touches no generated document; the two migrations and
  the regenerated references are M3's.

## M2: the order that covers the sessions in flight

PR #417.

### What landed

In the order the commits tell it: the writer's half, the publication
that reaches it, and the suite that arranges every interleaving it
claims.

- **`conversations/store.py` gains `renamed(old, new)`,** `erased()`'s
  sibling: it reaches the same register of writers with a different
  fact, is called after the renaming transaction has committed and
  inside `erasure_order()`, and skips a no-op rename. The comment above
  `_erasure_order` gains the rename as its second holder and says what
  the property both holders need really is, which is that every store
  change a live writer must observe atomically is published under it;
  `erasure_order()`'s own docstring now names both pairings. The lock
  keeps the erasure's name, per the plan.
- **`ConversationStore` gains the translation.** One map per recording
  session, `_renames`, guarded by the lock the producer state is guarded
  by, because a publication writes it from a request thread and the
  writer reads it inside its durable transaction. `open_session`
  registers an empty map, which is what makes a session translatable at
  all; `translate(old, new)` is `forget`'s sibling and marks every
  session live at that instant, composing on insert so a chain of
  renames resolves in one lookup; `_retire` drops a session's map where
  `_devices` is dropped, at the Close marker and at the tombstone.
- **The resolution sits at the durable-write boundary.** `_write` reads
  the session's translations once for the whole marker (`_naming`) and
  resolves each turn's agent once, handing that one value to
  `_turn_row`, which now takes it as an argument, and to the `Landing`.
  `_leg` resolves its own agent through the same map. `_session_row` is
  untouched.
- **`config/store.py`'s `rename_agent` enters the order before it opens
  its transaction and publishes after the commit, still inside it.** Two
  lines and a docstring paragraph; nothing else about the write moved.
- **`tests/unit/test_agent_rename_in_flight.py`,** nine cases: the two
  defects with the writer parked and the rename committing in front of
  it, the ordering lock's own claim, the row read back whole, a leg
  naming a second renamed agent, an agent nothing renamed, a chain of
  renames, a batch queued behind a close, and the freed name given to a
  new agent.

### Deviations from the plan

Two, both narrower than the sentence they refine, and one open question
the plan's own test list asks for that the code cannot answer.

1. **A leg is resolved on its own account, not with the turn's one
   value.** The plan says the resolution is "one lookup per turn"
   handed to `_turn_row`, the legs and the landing. Applied literally to
   a leg naming a DIFFERENT agent, that would file a handover leg under
   the turn's agent, which is a worse row than the one the amendment
   exists to prevent. So the turn's own agent is resolved once and
   shared with the landing, which is the whole of the P1 amendment, and
   each leg is resolved through the same map: a leg equal to the turn's
   agent therefore yields exactly the same value, and a leg naming a
   second agent that was also renamed carries the name that agent has
   now. `test_a_leg_naming_a_second_renamed_agent_moves_with_it` is the
   case.

2. **The map is read once per marker rather than once per turn.** The
   plan says the writer resolves "once per turn at the durable-write
   boundary", which is about WHERE the resolution happens rather than
   how often the map is looked up. `_write` runs inside the durable
   transaction, which is inside `_erasure_order`, and a rename holds
   that lock across its commit AND its publication, so the map cannot
   change while the transaction is open. One read for the whole marker
   is therefore the same answer as one per turn, and it is the reading
   that cannot produce a marker whose rows disagree with each other.

### Discoveries

- **The retirement's only observable is the batch queued behind the
  close.** Retiring a session's translations when its close is ENQUEUED
  rather than when it COMMITS takes them from a turn still queued in
  front of the close, and that turn then lands under the old name and is
  refused; that is the case, and it is what the pin asserts. Retiring
  them LATER than the plan says, or never, has no behavioural
  consequence at all, because a session id is never reused: the cost is
  a leak rather than a defect. So the placement is pinned in the one
  direction a test can see, and the other direction is the plan's design
  bound rather than an assertion.

- **A landing-only translation really does pass the thread-owner
  assertions.** Verified by mutation rather than reasoned about: with
  `_turn_row` and `_leg` reading the record while the landing is
  translated, the two defect cases still pass, and what fails is the
  case that reads the row back. That is the terra P1 finding reproduced
  as a test result, and it is why the pin reads `turns.agent` and every
  `legs[].agent` rather than the thread's owner.

- **The publication reaches the writer register and not the listener
  register beside it.** The memory store attaches to the second one for
  erasures, so "not a second subscriber" is a single line in `renamed()`
  rather than a decision spread over the call site: the function names
  itself as the hook a change of that decision would attach to.

### Open questions the plan left, and what M2 answers

None left open. The follow-up the plan says this milestone files is
filed: the memory store's untranslated window, with
`conversations.store.renamed()` named as the hook, the asymmetry
restated from the plan, and what a fix would have to decide. It carries
no number in any committed sentence, per the repository's rule that
landing code refers to a decision rather than to a tracker.

### Verification

- `uv run ruff check .`: clean.
- `uv run pytest tests/unit -q -n auto --dist loadfile`: 5764 passed,
  19 skipped.
- `uv run pytest tests/integration -q`: 243 passed.
- `scripts/check_doc_links.py .`: clean, 206 files.
- `uv run mypy`: clean.
- **Every concurrency pin verified to bite, by mutation, with each
  mutation reverted:**
  - No translation at all (`_write` resolving against an empty map):
    eight of the nine cases fail, and the writer's log carries the
    `MisattributedTurn` batch drop the plan predicted. The ninth is the
    agent nothing renamed, which is the case that must keep passing.
  - Translation at the landing alone: five cases fail, the two
    thread-owner cases pass, which is the terra P1 finding exactly.
  - Publication moved outside `erasure_order()`: the ordering pin alone
    fails, on the writer never arriving at the order, and the log again
    carries the dropped batch.
  - Retirement moved into `close_session`: the queued-batch pin alone
    fails.
  - One map for the whole process instead of one per session: the freed
    name pin alone fails.
- The generated-document drift checks: clean. M2 touches no generated
  document; the census manifest is regenerated in the last commit of the
  milestone as always.
