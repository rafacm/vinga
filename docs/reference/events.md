# Event schema reference

Generated from the declarations by `vinga-server events reference`. Do
not edit this file by hand: CI regenerates it and fails on any difference,
so an edit here is reverted by the next run. The declarations live in
`vinga-server/src/vinga_server/events/catalog.py`.

The structured events are this server's observability surface
([ADR](../adr/2026-08-04-json-logs-are-the-observability-surface.md)), and
they carry metadata and nothing else
([ADR](../adr/2026-08-15-content-and-telemetry-are-separate-surfaces.md)).
This document is that surface written down: 57 events in 82 variants. What was
said in a conversation is in the conversation store instead, keyed by the same
`session` ([its reference](conversations-schema.md)).

A site does not describe an emission; it constructs one. Every variant below
is a type, its values are types, and its sentence and argument order are
derived from its own fields, so an emission that is not one of these shapes
cannot be built at all. What is left at runtime is the construction itself,
which happens inside the emitter's guard: a construction that refuses is said
once on the emitter's own channel and dropped, because a telemetry bug must
never cost a reply.

The [README's Logging section](../../vinga-server/README.md#logging) is the
human overview, with one line per event saying when it fires.

## How to read it

A variant is one whole emission shape: where it rides, how loud it is, the
sentence it renders, the arguments that sentence takes, and the payload it
carries. Events have more than one because the surface does:
`session_rejected` is emitted with three arities across four templates on two
channels, `mcp_reload`'s applied and refused answers carry mutually exclusive
fields, and several events change level with shape. A site constructs exactly
one of them.

The template is byte-exact, and the argument table's rows are its `%`
positions in order. A message that is not one of the declared templates fails
even when every field is lawful, because the rendered sentence reaches the
same taps the payload does.

A variant's field table is the WHOLE payload a tap receives, base fields
included: `event` everywhere, and `session` and `device` on the session
channel, where the emitter owns them and a variant declaring one is refused at
import. On a server channel `session` and `device` are ordinary fields,
declared where they are carried. Required says the field is always present in
that variant; nullable says it may be present and null. An argument position
carries the same nullability column, for the positions whose value the
sentence may have to render as nothing.

Two per-frame samples are outside all of this on purpose. The endpointer track
and the dropped-frame counts are capture side channels rather than events, so
they are outside the tap contract and outside this registry, which is what
keeps validation a cost paid per decision rather than per frame.

## The channels

The channel is the scope. One session channel, `vinga_server.session`, carries
everything a conversation says about itself; the 13 server channels are each a
subsystem's own module name. An event declared on one channel and emitted from
another is a violation even when its fields are lawful.

- `vinga_server.session`
- `vinga_server.app`
- `vinga_server.capture`
- `vinga_server.config.api`
- `vinga_server.conversations.store`
- `vinga_server.device.bindings`
- `vinga_server.filler`
- `vinga_server.onboarding`
- `vinga_server.ota`
- `vinga_server.providers.openai_asr`
- `vinga_server.registry`
- `vinga_server.tools.mcp`
- `vinga_server.tools.memory`
- `vinga_server.ws`

## What a value may be

There is no free-text kind, which is the property the whole vocabulary exists
to keep. Every string field is one of these, and a field that would need prose
is a design error the taxonomy refuses to encode. A trusted identifier's
domain is a non-empty string once stripped, as NonBlankStr defines it: what
the configuration itself guarantees, since a value type claiming more would
refuse a lawful deployment's traffic.

| Kind | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `IDENTIFIER` | A trusted name the operator or this server chose: an agent, a configured entry, a pipeline stage, a path, an origin. Trusted is about provenance rather than shape, so its domain is the configuration's own and no tighter. |
| `TOKEN` | One value out of the field's declared closed set, listed in full below. |
| `CLASS_NAME` | An exception or type name. Never a message: a type name says what went wrong, a message says what a stranger wrote. |
| `ID` | A bounded machine form this server minted or normalized, held to a named syntax rather than to a generic length. |
| `DESCRIPTOR` | A far-side string retained deliberately: what a device says about itself at check-in, bounded and stripped of unprintables at its decision site and bounded again at emit. |
| `INT` | A whole number. Booleans are refused, since `True` is an `int` to Python. |
| `FLOAT` | A finite number, whole or fractional. Infinities and NaN are refused: they are not measurements and JSON cannot carry them. |
| `BOOL` | `True` or `False`. |
| `COUNT` | A whole number of zero or more, for the fields whose meaning is how many. |
| `IDENTIFIER_LIST` | A list whose every element is an `IDENTIFIER`. |
| `ID_LIST` | A list whose every element is an `ID` of the field's declared syntax. |
| `SOURCES` | The one structured kind: a mapping from prompt provenance to character counts, keyed by the grammar below. |

A `TOKEN` field's constraint column lists its whole set. A value that is
empty, or that begins or ends with a space, is printed quoted there, for the
reason the patterns below are: a bare code span shows neither, and a set whose
members cannot be read exactly is not a closed set.

## What an argument may be

The sentence's `%` positions have their own taxonomy beside the field kinds,
because a rendered sentence carries shapes no payload field does.

| Kind | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `IDENTIFIER` | As the field kind. |
| `TOKEN` | As the field kind. |
| `CLASS_NAME` | As the field kind. |
| `ID` | As the field kind. |
| `DESCRIPTOR` | As the field kind, reusing the bounds of the field this position renders: a lawful descriptor necessarily reaches the sentence that shows it. |
| `INT` | As the field kind. |
| `FLOAT` | As the field kind. |
| `BOOL` | As the field kind. |
| `COUNT` | As the field kind. |
| `PATHLIKE` | A trusted configured path, `Path` or `str`. Argument-only: the payload field beside it carries the same path as an `IDENTIFIER`. |
| `COMPOSED` | A formatted fragment of identifiers, held to the named grammar below rather than to a string type. Argument-only, and the reason `IDENTIFIER` was not widened to cover punctuation. |

## The id syntaxes

What an `ID` field is held to. Each is anchored at both ends when it is
matched, so a pattern cannot admit a prefix. Patterns are printed quoted, here
and below, because a leading or trailing space is part of several of them and
a bare code span would hide it.

| Syntax | Pattern | Longest | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mac` | `'[0-9a-f]{2}(?::[0-9a-f]{2}){5}'` | 17 | The canonical form `normalize_mac` answers with. |
| `reported_mac` | `'[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}(?:[:-][0-9A-Fa-f]{2}){5}'` | 17 | The Device-Id header as the firmware sent it, which the OTA sentence renders beside the normalized form the field carries. Only a header `normalize_mac` accepted ever reaches that sentence, so the looser separator and case are the whole of the difference. |
| `session_id` | `'[0-9A-Za-z_-]{1,64}'` | 64 | A token this server minted. Production ids are `uuid4().hex`; the syntax is the bounded machine form rather than that one spelling, because the capture and store suites drive sessions of their own naming and a session id is never far-side bytes whoever chose it. |
| `activation_code` | `'[0-9]{6}'` | 6 | A claim ticket read off a screen, not a credential. |
| `event_name` | `'[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,63}'` | 64 | The registry's own key, carried in the payload as `event`. |
| `language` | `'[A-Za-z]{2,3}(?:[-_][A-Za-z0-9]{1,8})*'` | 16 | A language code as an ASR engine reports it: the bare ISO 639 code or a tagged form such as `en-US`. |

## The composed grammars

What a `COMPOSED` argument is held to, with the code that builds it. Naming
the builder is what keeps a grammar honest: a fragment nobody assembles is a
pattern somebody guessed. They are bounded by structure rather than by
character class or length, since what a fragment promises is its shape and
never what an operator may have called something.

| Grammar | Pattern | Built by | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `empty_fragment` | `''` | `vinga_server.events.values:Nothing` | The nothing a site renders where it has nothing to add. Declared rather than left untyped, so a variant that may only say nothing says exactly that. |
| `also_bound_to` | `'(?: \(also bound to [\s\S]+\))?'` | `vinga_server.events.values:AlsoBoundTo.of` | The tail naming the agents a device is bound to beside the one that answered, empty for a device bound to exactly one. The names inside it are comma joined, and the grammar does not say so: a configured name may itself hold a comma, so the joined fragment cannot be parsed back into the names that made it, and a pattern claiming otherwise would refuse a lawful deployment. |
| `agent_list` | `'[\s\S]+'` | `vinga_server.events.values:AgentList.of` | The configured agent names a device is bound to, comma-joined. Non-empty, and nothing further: see the tail grammar above for why the joining is not part of the claim. |
| `session_list` | `'[0-9A-Za-z_-]{1,64}(?:, [0-9A-Za-z_-]{1,64})*'` | `vinga_server.events.values:SessionList.of` | The session ids a prune removed, comma-joined. |
| `quoted_tool_name` | `' "[\s\S]+"'` | `vinga_server.events.values:QuotedToolName.of` | A builtin's name, which is this server's own word, bounded here by the quoting alone. A device tool's name is the board's vocabulary and an unknown one is whatever the model invented, so neither is ever rendered here. |
| `from_entry` | `' from entry "[\s\S]+"'` | `vinga_server.events.values:FromEntry.of` | The configured MCP entry a call reached, never the far side's own tool name. Entry names are separately held to `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` by the configuration, which makes this grammar a floor rather than the whole truth; the floor is what this surface may claim, since the tighter rule is configuration's to keep and to change. |
| `quoted_provider` | `'(?: "[\s\S]+")?'` | `vinga_server.events.values:QuotedProvider.of` | The configuration entry the failing provider is, bounded by the quoting alone, and empty for a provider the registry never built. Optional for the reason the host tail below is: one variant says both, and a rendered position cannot be absent. |
| `reaching_host` | `'(?: reaching [\s\S]+)?'` | `vinga_server.events.values:ReachingHost.of` | Where the call was going, empty for an engine that runs in this process. |
| `origin_provenance` | `'(?:from\|guessed from) [\s\S]+'` | `vinga_server.onboarding.origin:Origin.provenance`, `vinga_server.events.values:OriginProvenance` | Which configuration key the banner's origin came out of, and whether it was read or inferred. |
| `device_or_unidentified` | `'[0-9a-f]{2}(?::[0-9a-f]{2}){5}\|an unidentified device'` | `vinga_server.events.values:DeviceOrUnidentified.of` | The MAC behind a Device-Id header this server recognizes, or the fixed phrase. Nothing else: with device auth off nothing has verified that header, so an unrecognized one names no device at all. |

## The prompt provenance grammar

`prompt_assembled.sources` is the one structured field: a mapping from where a
block of the prompt came from to how many characters it contributed, never any
of the prompt itself. Its keys take these forms, with `<name>` and `<entry>`
configured names and `<position>` a positive integer.

- `persona`
- `fragment:<name>`
- `instructions:<entry>`
- `server_instructions:<entry>`
- `server_prompt:<entry>:<position>`

`memory` is deliberately not among them. `prompt_assembled` reports the cached
know-how half of the prompt and excludes the per-round memory read, so a
`memory` key is a violation like any unknown prefix, even though it is a
provenance token elsewhere in the prompt assembly.

```text
persona|fragment:[A-Za-z0-9_-]+|instructions:[A-Za-z0-9_-]+|server_instructions:[A-Za-z0-9_-]+|server_prompt:[A-Za-z0-9_-]+:[1-9][0-9]*
```

One row per event, in the order the sections below run: the order a request
meets them, from a device's check-in to the server's own lifecycle surfaces.

to it. Said once, before anything connects, and at WARNING for the reason
`capture_enabled` is.

### `speaking_started`

The reply's first audio frame goes out.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

### `heard`

An utterance is transcribed. No transcript: what was said is the conversation
store's, and what an operator measures with is how long the user spoke.

### `prompt_assembled`

The know-how half of a prompt is assembled and cached. The per-round memory
read is deliberately not part of it, which is why `memory` is not one of the
provenance forms.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

```text

```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |

### `llm_retry`

The first-token watchdog cancels a stalled generation and retries the round
once.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at WARNING

`provider` and `type` are atomic: a provider with an identity carries both,
and one the registry never built carries neither. `host` is absent for an
engine that runs in this process and `model` for a type that has none to name.

```text

### `llm_round`

A generation call finishes.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

```text

| `output_tokens` | `COUNT` | no | no |  |  |
| `first_token_ms` | `INT` | no | no |  | Times the first spoken token, so a round that only asked for a tool carries none. |

### `provider_failed`

An ASR, LLM or TTS call fails. The class name is reported and the exception's
message is not: a type name says what went wrong, a message says what a
stranger wrote.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at WARNING

`provider` and `type` are atomic: a provider with an identity carries both,
and one the registry never built carries neither and names no entry and no
host in the sentence either. `host` is absent for an engine that runs in this
process and `model` for a type that has none to name.

### `tool_call`

A tool returns. `source` says which namespace the model reached into; the name
itself is only ever this server's own word for it.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

the model invented, so neither is named.

### `onboarding_key_mismatch`

A request carried a key-shaped segment, and not this server's. Neither is
repeated.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.onboarding` at WARNING

```text

### `asr_prompt_echo`

A transcript came back as the ASR prompt and the clip was retried once without
