# Event schema reference

Generated from the declarations by `vinga-server events reference`. Do
not edit this file by hand: CI regenerates it and fails on any difference,
so an edit here is reverted by the next run. The declarations live in
`vinga-server/src/vinga_server/events/catalog.py`.

The structured events are this server's observability surface
([ADR](../adr/2026-08-04-json-logs-are-the-observability-surface.md)), and
they carry metadata and nothing else
([ADR](../adr/2026-08-15-content-and-telemetry-are-separate-surfaces.md)).
This document is that surface written down: 73 events in 102 variants. What
was said in a conversation is in the conversation store instead, keyed by the
same `session` ([its reference](conversations-schema.md)).

A site does not describe an emission; it constructs one. Every variant below
is a type, its values are types, and its sentence and argument order are
derived from its own fields, so an emission that is not one of these shapes
cannot be built at all. What is left at runtime is the construction itself,
which happens inside the emitter's guard: a construction that refuses is said
once on the emitter's own channel and dropped, because a telemetry bug must
never cost a reply.

The [README's Logging section](../../vinga-server/README.md#logging) is the
human overview, with one line per event saying when it fires.

## How to read it

A variant is one whole emission shape: where it rides, how loud it is, the
sentence it renders, the arguments that sentence takes, and the payload it
carries. Events have more than one because the surface does:
`session_rejected` is emitted with three arities across four templates on two
channels, `mcp_reload`'s applied and refused answers carry mutually exclusive
fields, and several events change level with shape. A site constructs exactly
one of them.

The template is byte-exact, and the argument table's rows are its `%`
positions in order, each naming the declared field whose value that position
renders. A message that is not one of the declared templates fails even when
every field is lawful, because the rendered sentence reaches the same taps the
payload does.

A variant's field table is the WHOLE payload a tap receives, base fields
included: `event` everywhere, and `session` and `device` on the session
channel, where the emitter owns them and a variant declaring one is refused at
import. On a server channel `session` and `device` are ordinary fields,
declared where they are carried. Required says the field is always present in
that variant; nullable says it may be present and null. An argument position
carries the same nullability column, for the positions whose value the
sentence may have to render as nothing.

This catalog is also a LIVE surface. The same emissions are streamed to an
authenticated operator over `GET /api/runtime/events`, one JSON object per
event, and what rides there is what is documented here plus two fields the
stream owns: `ts`, the wall-clock instant the event was emitted at, and
`level`, the name of the level in that variant's row. Nothing is kept behind
that stream, which is what makes it a second transport over this surface
rather than a store: a reader joins the present, and what happened before is
the conversation record's to answer. A reader who needs the exact object reads
the JSON log, which is the retained copy of the same records.

Two per-frame samples are outside all of this on purpose. The endpointer track
and the dropped-frame counts are capture side channels rather than events, so
they are outside the tap contract and outside this registry, which is what
keeps validation a cost paid per decision rather than per frame.

## The channels

The channel is the scope. One session channel, `vinga_server.session`, carries
everything a conversation says about itself; the 14 server channels are each a
subsystem's own module name. An event declared on one channel and emitted from
another is a violation even when its fields are lawful.

- `vinga_server.session`
- `vinga_server.app`
- `vinga_server.capture`
- `vinga_server.config.api`
- `vinga_server.conversations.store`
- `vinga_server.device.bindings`
- `vinga_server.filler`
- `vinga_server.memory.store`
- `vinga_server.onboarding`
- `vinga_server.ota`
- `vinga_server.providers.openai_asr`
- `vinga_server.providers.world`
- `vinga_server.registry`
- `vinga_server.tools.mcp`
- `vinga_server.ws`

## What a value may be

There is no free-text kind, which is the property the whole vocabulary exists
to keep. Every string field is one of these, and a field that would need prose
is a design error the taxonomy refuses to encode. A trusted identifier's
domain is a non-empty string once stripped, as NonBlankStr defines it: what
the configuration itself guarantees, since a value type claiming more would
refuse a lawful deployment's traffic.

| Kind | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `IDENTIFIER` | A trusted name the operator or this server chose: an agent, a configured entry, a pipeline stage, a path, an origin. Trusted is about provenance rather than shape, so its domain is the configuration's own and no tighter. |
| `TOKEN` | One value out of the field's declared closed set, listed in full below. |
| `CLASS_NAME` | An exception or type name. Never a message: a type name says what went wrong, a message says what a stranger wrote. |
| `ID` | A bounded machine form this server minted or normalized, held to a named syntax rather than to a generic length. |
| `DESCRIPTOR` | A far-side string retained deliberately: what a device says about itself at check-in, bounded and stripped of unprintables at its decision site and bounded again at emit. |
| `INT` | A whole number. Booleans are refused, since `True` is an `int` to Python. |
| `FLOAT` | A finite number, whole or fractional. Infinities and NaN are refused: they are not measurements and JSON cannot carry them. |
| `BOOL` | `True` or `False`. |
| `COUNT` | A whole number of zero or more, for the fields whose meaning is how many. |
| `IDENTIFIER_LIST` | A list whose every element is an `IDENTIFIER`. |
| `ID_LIST` | A list whose every element is an `ID` of the field's declared syntax. |
| `SOURCES` | A mapping from prompt provenance to character counts, keyed by the grammar below. |
| `DROP_COUNTS` | A mapping from the reasons a mic frame is discarded to how many frames one second lost to each. Every key is a declared reason and every value a count of one or more. |
| `PROVIDER_ENTRIES` | A mapping from each bound agent to its pipeline stages, and from a stage to the resolved entry's `name`, `type` and, where the type has them, `host` and `model`. Nothing else off a provider entry reaches it, so no configured option and no credential can. |

A `TOKEN` field's constraint column lists its whole set. A value that is
empty, or that begins or ends with a space, is printed quoted there, for the
reason the patterns below are: a bare code span shows neither, and a set whose
members cannot be read exactly is not a closed set.

## What an argument may be

The sentence's `%` positions have their own taxonomy beside the field kinds,
because a rendered sentence carries shapes no payload field does.

| Kind | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `IDENTIFIER` | As the field kind. |
| `TOKEN` | As the field kind. |
| `CLASS_NAME` | As the field kind. |
| `ID` | As the field kind. |
| `DESCRIPTOR` | As the field kind, reusing the bounds of the field this position renders: a lawful descriptor necessarily reaches the sentence that shows it. |
| `INT` | As the field kind. |
| `FLOAT` | As the field kind. |
| `BOOL` | As the field kind. |
| `COUNT` | As the field kind. |
| `PATHLIKE` | A trusted configured path, `Path` or `str`. Argument-only: the payload field beside it carries the same path as an `IDENTIFIER`. |
| `COMPOSED` | A formatted fragment of identifiers, held to the named grammar below rather than to a string type. Argument-only, and the reason `IDENTIFIER` was not widened to cover punctuation. |

## The id syntaxes

What an `ID` field is held to. Each is anchored at both ends when it is
matched, so a pattern cannot admit a prefix. Patterns are printed quoted, here
and below, because a leading or trailing space is part of several of them and
a bare code span would hide it.

| Syntax | Pattern | Longest | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mac` | `'[0-9a-f]{2}(?::[0-9a-f]{2}){5}'` | 17 | The canonical form `normalize_mac` answers with. |
| `reported_mac` | `'[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}(?:[:-][0-9A-Fa-f]{2}){5}'` | 17 | The Device-Id header as the firmware sent it, which the OTA sentence renders beside the normalized form the field carries. Only a header `normalize_mac` accepted ever reaches that sentence, so the looser separator and case are the whole of the difference. |
| `session_id` | `'[0-9A-Za-z_-]{1,64}'` | 64 | A token this server minted. Production ids are `uuid4().hex`; the syntax is the bounded machine form rather than that one spelling, because the capture and store suites drive sessions of their own naming and a session id is never far-side bytes whoever chose it. |
| `conversation_id` | `'[0-9A-Za-z_-]{1,64}'` | 64 | A token this server minted for one conversation thread. Production ids are `uuid4().hex`, the same shape and the same bounded machine form a session id takes, and for the same reason: the store suites drive threads of their own naming, and a thread id is never far-side bytes whoever chose it. |
| `activation_code` | `'[0-9]{6}'` | 6 | A claim ticket read off a screen, not a credential. |
| `event_name` | `'[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,63}'` | 64 | The registry's own key, carried in the payload as `event`. |
| `language` | `'[A-Za-z]{2,3}(?:[-_][A-Za-z0-9]{1,8})*'` | 16 | A language code as an ASR engine reports it: the bare ISO 639 code or a tagged form such as `en-US`. |

## The composed grammars

What a `COMPOSED` argument is held to, with the code that builds it. Naming
the builder is what keeps a grammar honest: a fragment nobody assembles is a
pattern somebody guessed. They are bounded by structure rather than by
character class or length, since what a fragment promises is its shape and
never what an operator may have called something.

| Grammar | Pattern | Built by | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `empty_fragment` | `''` | `vinga_server.events.values:Nothing` | The nothing a site renders where it has nothing to add. Declared rather than left untyped, so a variant that may only say nothing says exactly that. |
| `also_bound_to` | `'(?: \(also bound to [\s\S]+\))?'` | `vinga_server.events.values:AlsoBoundTo.of` | The tail naming the agents a device is bound to beside the one that answered, empty for a device bound to exactly one. The names inside it are comma joined, and the grammar does not say so: a configured name may itself hold a comma, so the joined fragment cannot be parsed back into the names that made it, and a pattern claiming otherwise would refuse a lawful deployment. |
| `agent_list` | `'[\s\S]+'` | `vinga_server.events.values:AgentList.of` | The configured agent names a device is bound to, comma-joined. Non-empty, and nothing further: see the tail grammar above for why the joining is not part of the claim. |
| `session_list` | `'[0-9A-Za-z_-]{1,64}(?:, [0-9A-Za-z_-]{1,64})*'` | `vinga_server.events.values:SessionList.of` | The session ids a prune removed, comma-joined. |
| `quoted_tool_name` | `' "[\s\S]+"'` | `vinga_server.events.values:QuotedToolName.of` | A builtin's name, which is this server's own word, bounded here by the quoting alone. A device tool's name is the board's vocabulary and an unknown one is whatever the model invented, so neither is ever rendered here. |
| `from_entry` | `' from entry "[\s\S]+"'` | `vinga_server.events.values:FromEntry.of` | The configured MCP entry a call reached, never the far side's own tool name. Entry names are separately held to `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` by the configuration, which makes this grammar a floor rather than the whole truth; the floor is what this surface may claim, since the tighter rule is configuration's to keep and to change. |
| `quoted_provider` | `'(?: "[\s\S]+")?'` | `vinga_server.events.values:QuotedProvider.of` | The configuration entry the failing provider is, bounded by the quoting alone, and empty for a provider the registry never built. Optional for the reason the host tail below is: one variant says both, and a rendered position cannot be absent. |
| `reaching_host` | `'(?: reaching [\s\S]+)?'` | `vinga_server.events.values:ReachingHost.of` | Where the call was going, empty for an engine that runs in this process. |
| `origin_provenance` | `'(?:from\|guessed from) [\s\S]+'` | `vinga_server.onboarding.origin:Origin.provenance`, `vinga_server.events.values:OriginProvenance` | Which configuration key the banner's origin came out of, and whether it was read or inferred. |
| `device_or_unidentified` | `'[0-9a-f]{2}(?::[0-9a-f]{2}){5}\|an unidentified device'` | `vinga_server.events.values:DeviceOrUnidentified.of` | The MAC behind a Device-Id header this server recognizes, or the fixed phrase. Nothing else: with device auth off nothing has verified that header, so an unrecognized one names no device at all. |

## The prompt provenance grammar

`prompt_assembled.sources` is the one structured field: a mapping from where a
block of the prompt came from to how many characters it contributed, never any
of the prompt itself. Its keys take these forms, with `<name>` and `<entry>`
configured names and `<position>` a positive integer.

- `persona`
- `fragment:<name>`
- `instructions:<entry>`
- `server_instructions:<entry>`
- `server_prompt:<entry>:<position>`

`memory` is deliberately not among them. `prompt_assembled` reports the cached
know-how half of the prompt and excludes the per-round memory read, so a
`memory` key is a violation like any unknown prefix, even though it is a
provenance token elsewhere in the prompt assembly.

```text
persona|fragment:[A-Za-z0-9_-]+|instructions:[A-Za-z0-9_-]+|server_instructions:[A-Za-z0-9_-]+|server_prompt:[A-Za-z0-9_-]+:[1-9][0-9]*
```

### `conversations_enabled`

The store opens at startup, which means this server is recording what is said
to it. Said once, before anything connects, and at WARNING for the reason
`capture_enabled` is.

session %s open: device %s (client %s) agent %s%s, protocol v%d, %d Hz %d ms frames in
```

| `agents` | `IDENTIFIER_LIST` | yes | no |  |  |
| `providers` | `PROVIDER_ENTRIES` | yes | no | agent, then stage, then `name`, `type`, `host`, `model` | What this conversation opened against, for every agent the device is bound to: the entry, its type, the host it reaches and the model it runs, per pipeline stage. The one derivation the capture manifest reads too. A world applied mid-session does not move it: what a record says is what the conversation opened with. |
| `protocol` | `INT` | yes | no |  |  |
| `revision` | `IDENTIFIER` | yes | no |  | Which build this server is, so every session from here on is attributable to one. |

### `session_limit`

The duration cap fires.

```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |

```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `reason` | `TOKEN` | yes | no | one of: `client`, `drain`, `error`, `idle`, `limit` | The first cause to fire, so a drain closing a session an idle timer was about to hang up on reads `drain`. |

### `speaking_started`

The reply's first audio frame goes out.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

```text
session %s: speaking started
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `session` (`ID`) | no | the `session_id` syntax |  |

| `agent` | `IDENTIFIER` | yes | no |  |  |
| `conversation` | `ID` | yes | no | the `conversation_id` syntax | The thread the agent was talking on, stamped by the same activation that stamped the agent. A server-minted id and therefore metadata; what was said on the thread is the store's. |

### `speaking_finished`

The reply's last audio frame has gone out, which with `speaking_started`
bounds the interval the frame pacer actually paces. A reply that never spoke
emits none.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

```text
session %s: speaking finished after %d frame(s)
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `conversation` | `ID` | yes | no | the `conversation_id` syntax | The thread the agent was talking on, stamped by the same activation that stamped the agent. A server-minted id and therefore metadata; what was said on the thread is the store's. |
| `frames` | `COUNT` | yes | no |  | How many frames of this reply the device was actually sent, counted after each delivery returned and kept across a handover: what the interval bounds is one reply's audio, however many agents produced it. |

### `frames_dropped`

One second of mic frames the edge's guards discarded before they could be
decoded, counted by reason. Counted whether or not this deployment records
anything, and flushed at the session's close so a partial second is not lost.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at DEBUG

```text
session %s: dropped mic frames in second %d
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |

| `reasons` | `DROP_COUNTS` | yes | no | keyed by `barge_in_off`, `framing_error`, `not_listening`, `not_opus`, `undecodable`, with frame counts for values | How many frames went to each of the edge's own guards. Every key is one of this server's words and every value a count of frames; nothing of a frame itself is on the record. |

### `turn_started`

A reply attempt begins, at every successful `start_reply`. Stamped with the
instant the user stopped speaking, which the floor preserves across the
barge-in gate.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

```text
session %s: answering %d ms of speech
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `session` (`ID`) | no | the `session_id` syntax |  |

| `conversation` | `ID` | yes | no | the `conversation_id` syntax | The thread the agent was talking on, stamped by the same activation that stamped the agent. A server-minted id and therefore metadata; what was said on the thread is the store's. |
| `speech_ms` | `INT` | yes | no |  | How much of what was fed the endpointer classified as speech. |
| `barge_in` | `BOOL` | yes | no |  | Whether this turn interrupted a reply in flight, which is true for a confirmed barge-in, a mid-ASR merge and a manual stop that cut one short. |

### `reply_finished`

A reply ends, however it ended: exactly one per `turn_started`, with an
outcome latched where the end was decided rather than inferred from a
cancellation.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

```text
session %s: reply finished (%s) after %d sentence(s)
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `session` (`ID`) | no | the `session_id` syntax |  |
| 2 | `outcome` (`TOKEN`) | no | one of: `aborted`, `barged_in`, `completed`, `device_gone`, `failed`, `nothing_heard` |  |
| 3 | `sentences_spoken` (`COUNT`) | no |  |  |

| Field | Kind | Required | Nullable | Constraint | Note |

| `conversation` | `ID` | yes | no | the `conversation_id` syntax | The thread the agent was talking on, stamped by the same activation that stamped the agent. A server-minted id and therefore metadata; what was said on the thread is the store's. |
| `outcome` | `TOKEN` | yes | no | one of: `aborted`, `barged_in`, `completed`, `device_gone`, `failed`, `nothing_heard` | Latched at the boundary that ended the reply rather than guessed from a cancellation, which cannot tell a barge-in from a shutdown. First writer wins; an unlatched exit is `completed`. |
| `sentences_spoken` | `COUNT` | yes | no |  | How many sentences of it the user heard, counted the way `replied` counts them: audio that actually went out. |

### `heard`

An utterance is transcribed. No transcript: what was said is the conversation
store's, and what an operator measures with is how long the user spoke.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

```text
session %s: heard %.2f s of speech
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `session` (`ID`) | no | the `session_id` syntax |  |

| `conversation` | `ID` | yes | no | the `conversation_id` syntax | The thread the agent was talking on, stamped by the same activation that stamped the agent. A server-minted id and therefore metadata; what was said on the thread is the store's. |
| `duration_s` | `FLOAT` | yes | no |  |  |
| `asr_ms` | `INT` | no | no |  | What the transcription cost, measured where it was run. An interrupting turn carries the latency the barge-in gate measured for its own confirmation, since that is the transcription this turn is answering. |
| `language` | `ID` | no | no | the `language` syntax | Only engines that detected carry this. |
| `language_confidence` | `FLOAT` | no | no |  |  |

### `nothing_heard`

An utterance is transcribed to nothing at all, which is one of the four ways
an utterance's ASR stage ends, beside `heard`, `provider_failed` and
`transcription_abandoned`. No text field, by type.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

```text
session %s: nothing transcribed from %.2f s of speech
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `session` (`ID`) | no | the `session_id` syntax |  |

| `device` | `ID` | yes | yes | the `mac` syntax |  |
| `agent` | `IDENTIFIER` | yes | no |  |  |
| `conversation` | `ID` | yes | no | the `conversation_id` syntax | The thread the agent was talking on, stamped by the same activation that stamped the agent. A server-minted id and therefore metadata; what was said on the thread is the store's. |
| `duration_s` | `FLOAT` | yes | no |  | How long the utterance that produced nothing was. |
| `asr_ms` | `INT` | no | no |  | What the transcription that answered nothing cost. |

### `transcription_abandoned`

A transcription was given up on before it answered, because the reply it
belonged to was cancelled with the call still running. The one ASR outcome
that is not about the engine, and deliberately not `provider_failed`: nothing
failed, the answer was no longer wanted.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

```text
session %s: transcription of %.2f s abandoned after %d ms
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `session` (`ID`) | no | the `session_id` syntax |  |
| 2 | `duration_s` (`FLOAT`) | no |  |  |

| `agent` | `IDENTIFIER` | yes | no |  |  |
| `conversation` | `ID` | yes | no | the `conversation_id` syntax | The thread the agent was talking on, stamped by the same activation that stamped the agent. A server-minted id and therefore metadata; what was said on the thread is the store's. |
| `duration_s` | `FLOAT` | yes | no |  | How long the utterance nobody transcribed was. |
| `asr_ms` | `INT` | yes | no |  | How long the call had been running when it was given up on, which is a bound on what it would have cost rather than what it did. |

### `sentence_synthesized`

One sentence of a reply has finished streaming out of the voice: the
provider's latency to its first chunk, and the stream's whole lifetime, which
includes playback backpressure.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at DEBUG

```text
session %s: sentence %d synthesized in %d ms
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `session` (`ID`) | no | the `session_id` syntax |  |
| 2 | `index` (`COUNT`) | no |  |  |

| `device` | `ID` | yes | yes | the `mac` syntax |  |
| `agent` | `IDENTIFIER` | yes | no |  |  |
| `conversation` | `ID` | yes | no | the `conversation_id` syntax | The thread the agent was talking on, stamped by the same activation that stamped the agent. A server-minted id and therefore metadata; what was said on the thread is the store's. |
| `index` | `COUNT` | yes | no |  | Which synthesis of this reply this was, counted from zero in the order the requests were made rather than in the order they answered. |
| `stream_ms` | `INT` | yes | no |  | The whole stream's lifetime, request to last chunk. It INCLUDES playback backpressure: the buffer holds one chunk, so a paced consumer is what decides when the provider is asked for the next one, and pure synthesis time is unobservable for a streaming voice. |
| `first_chunk_ms` | `INT` | no | no |  | The provider's latency to its first audio chunk, measured producer-side: the first chunk always finds buffer room, so this one number is backpressure-free. Absent where the stream produced no audio at all. |

### `replied`

A reply finishes.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

```text
session %s: %s replied in %d sentences
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `session` (`ID`) | no | the `session_id` syntax |  |

| `device` | `ID` | yes | yes | the `mac` syntax |  |
| `agent` | `IDENTIFIER` | yes | no |  |  |
| `conversation` | `ID` | yes | no | the `conversation_id` syntax | The thread the agent was talking on, stamped by the same activation that stamped the agent. A server-minted id and therefore metadata; what was said on the thread is the store's. |
| `sentences` | `COUNT` | yes | no |  | How many of them the user heard, so a reply a barge-in cut short reports what went out. |

### `agent_said`

One agent's part of a reply.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

```text
session %s: %s said %d sentences
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `session` (`ID`) | no | the `session_id` syntax |  |
| 2 | `agent` (`IDENTIFIER`) | no |  |  |

| `sentences` | `COUNT` | yes | no |  |  |

### `handover`

`switch_agent` succeeds.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

```text
session %s: handed over from agent %s to %s
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `session` (`ID`) | no | the `session_id` syntax |  |
| 2 | `from_agent` (`IDENTIFIER`) | no |  |  |

| `to_agent` | `IDENTIFIER` | yes | no |  |  |
| `from_conversation` | `ID` | yes | no | the `conversation_id` syntax | The thread the outgoing agent was on, which the handover turn belongs to. |
| `to_conversation` | `ID` | yes | no | the `conversation_id` syntax | The thread the incoming agent is on: its own, minted at its first activation in this session and continued at every later one. |

### `conversation_resumed`

A stored thread is picked up again, at the boundary the selection ended a
reply on. Counts and a flag: which thread, how much of it was rebuilt, how
much of it could not be, and whether there was more of it than the budget had
room for.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

```text
session %s: resumed conversation %s from %d stored turns
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `session` (`ID`) | no | the `session_id` syntax |  |

| `device` | `ID` | yes | yes | the `mac` syntax |  |
| `conversation` | `ID` | yes | no | the `conversation_id` syntax | The thread the session moved onto, which the agent that asked for it is bound to from here. |
| `turns` | `COUNT` | yes | no |  | How many stored turns were rebuilt into the model's context. A count and never the dialogue: what was said is the store's. |
| `skipped` | `COUNT` | yes | no |  | How many stored turns could not be rebuilt because no text was kept for them, which is what a thread recorded under the stricter storage setting leaves behind. |
| `over_budget` | `BOOL` | yes | no |  | Whether the thread held more than the hydration budget had room for, so what was rebuilt is its recent tail. |

### `milestone_recorded`

A consented recap is stored as a checkpoint on its thread, after the user has
heard it. The thread's identity and nothing else: what the recap says is what
a room said, so it is conversation content and belongs to the store.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

```text
session %s: recorded a recap milestone on conversation %s
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `session` (`ID`) | no | the `session_id` syntax |  |

| `device` | `ID` | yes | yes | the `mac` syntax |  |
| `conversation` | `ID` | yes | no | the `conversation_id` syntax | The thread the checkpoint was recorded on. The identity and nothing else: a recap is a summary of what a room said, so it is conversation content and lives in the store under the text switch, never on a decision track. |

### `prompt_assembled`

The know-how half of a prompt is assembled and cached. The per-round memory
read is deliberately not part of it, which is why `memory` is not one of the
provenance forms.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

```text
session %s: assembled %d characters of prompt for %s
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `session` (`ID`) | no | the `session_id` syntax |  |

| `conversation` | `ID` | yes | no | the `conversation_id` syntax | The thread the agent was talking on, stamped by the same activation that stamped the agent. A server-minted id and therefore metadata; what was said on the thread is the store's. |
| `characters` | `COUNT` | yes | no |  |  |
| `sources` | `SOURCES` | yes | no | keyed by the prompt provenance grammar, with counts for values | Each block's size by provenance: how much of the prompt came from where, never any of the prompt itself. |

### `llm_retry`

The first-token watchdog cancels a stalled generation and retries the round
once.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at WARNING

`provider` and `type` are atomic: a provider with an identity carries both,
and one the registry never built carries neither. `host` is absent for an
engine that runs in this process and `model` for a type that has none to name.

```text
session %s: no first token after %.1f s, retrying round %d
```

### `llm_round`

A generation call finishes.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

`provider` and `type` are atomic: a provider with an identity carries both,
and one the registry never built carries neither. `host` is absent for an
engine that runs in this process and `model` for a type that has none to name.

```text

### `provider_failed`

An ASR, LLM or TTS call fails. The class name is reported and the exception's
message is not: a type name says what went wrong, a message says what a
stranger wrote.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at WARNING

`provider` and `type` are atomic: a provider with an identity carries both,
and one the registry never built carries neither and names no entry and no
host in the sentence either. `host` is absent for an engine that runs in this
process and `model` for a type that has none to name.

### `tool_call`

A tool returns. `source` says which namespace the model reached into; the name
itself is only ever this server's own word for it.

the model invented, so neither is named.

### `tool_arguments_coerced`

A call went out with argument types this server corrected: a value whose
string form converts to the declared type exactly is converted once, at the
dispatch (#383). How many, and never which or to what.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

How many arguments were converted and never which or to what: a property name
is the far side's own word and a value is what the model wrote, and neither
belongs on a retained surface. What the record keeps is the arguments as the
model sent them, which is where the two can be compared.

```text
session %s: %s tool%s was called with %d argument(s) whose types the schema declares otherwise, converted for the call
```

| 3 | `named` (`COMPOSED`) | no |  | One of the three shapes of the `tool_call` naming policy, and any of them, because one variant carries all four sources: a builtin's own name quoted, the configured MCP entry a call reached, or nothing at all. |

| `coerced` | `COUNT` | yes | no |  | How many of the call's arguments were converted, which is one or more: the event is emitted only where the copy differs from what the model sent. |
| `tool` | `IDENTIFIER` | no | no |  | Present for a builtin, the only tool names this server authors. |
| `entry` | `IDENTIFIER` | no | no |  | Present for an MCP call: the configured entry, never the far side's tool name. |

### `sentence_withheld`

A sentence of a reply was shaped like a call to a tool this session offered,
so it was dropped instead of spoken. How long it was and which tool it was
shaped like, under the naming policy `tool_call` follows; never a byte of the
sentence itself.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

```text

| `characters` | `COUNT` | yes | no |  | How long the sentence was and never a byte of it. What was withheld is the model's own text about a tool it was offered, which is exactly the content this surface may not carry; the length is what tells a leaked call from a paragraph that happened to hold one. |

#### Variant 3: `vinga_server.session` at INFO

A device tool's name is the board's vocabulary, so it is not named. `unknown`
is also what a sentence carrying only arguments reports when they fit more
than one offered tool: it is withheld because every reading of it is
tool-shaped, and it names none of them because which one it was is exactly
what could not be decided.

### `ota_check`

What a device said about itself at its configuration check, and what this

### `ota_check_body`

The whole of what a board reported at its configuration check, for whoever is
bringing an unfamiliar one up: the partition table, the flash size and the
display block that no other surface keeps. At DEBUG, so no default-configured
deployment retains or shows it; `vinga events tail --level DEBUG` is how
somebody asks for it.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.ota` at DEBUG

A request carried a key-shaped segment, and not this server's. Neither is
repeated.

### `asr_prompt_echo`

A transcript came back as the ASR prompt and the clip was retried once without

The intentional one, a shutdown or a reload, and the only `mcp_down` at INFO.
No duration: how long a working connection lasted is a different number under
the same name.

### `mcp_call_dropped`

A tool call failed and the connection was dropped because of it. The tool is
said by its position in the far side's listing and never by its name: half a
published name is what the far side called its tool.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.tools.mcp` at WARNING

```text

| `error` | `CLASS_NAME` | yes | no | one name, or several joined with `, ` | The failure's class name, and for a group of them the sorted names joined with a comma. Never a message. |

### `mcp_tool_shadowed`

A published tool is dropped because a more specific entry owns its name.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.tools.mcp` at WARNING

```text
mcp server %s: dropping published tool %d, its name is inside the namespace of the entry %s, which owns it
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |

| `owner` | `IDENTIFIER` | yes | no |  |  |

### `mcp_reload`

A reload of the MCP servers finishes, whether or not the caller is still
connected. Exactly one per reload, at whichever of the two phases ended it.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.tools.mcp` at WARNING

```text

| `unchanged` | `COUNT` | yes | no |  |  |
| `duration_ms` | `INT` | yes | no |  | Measured from when the request was accepted, so it covers the re-read as well as the apply. |

### `provider_reaches_loopback`

A provider entry built inside a container names this machine in its endpoint,
which inside a container is the container. At WARNING and once per build of
the entry, on the boot and on every apply that rebuilds it. Never a refusal:
the same configuration is correct where the endpoint shares the container or
its network namespace.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.providers.world` at WARNING

A warning and never a refusal: localhost is right for an endpoint sharing this
container or its network namespace, and only the deployment knows which it is.

```text
providers.%s.%s reaches %s, which inside a container is the container itself rather than the machine running it; if that endpoint is on the machine, name it instead (host.docker.internal, which the compose file resolves on every platform) and apply
```

### `memory_unreadable`

One scope of an agent's memory could not be read, so the agent remembers
nothing of it this round. Said once per scope the read could not answer, since
a read that serves a whole prompt answers three of them.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.memory.store` at WARNING

```text
could not read %s memory for agent %s (%s); it remembers nothing of it this round
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `scope` (`TOKEN`) | no | one of: `agent`, `conversation`, `device` |  |
| 2 | `agent` (`IDENTIFIER`) | no |  |  |
| 3 | `error` (`CLASS_NAME`) | no |  |  |

| Field | Kind | Required | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `event` | `ID` | yes | no | the `event_name` syntax |  |
| `agent` | `IDENTIFIER` | yes | no |  | The agent whose reply the read was for, which is the acting agent rather than the owner of the rows: a device scope is read on behalf of whichever agent is speaking on that device. |
| `scope` | `TOKEN` | yes | no | one of: `agent`, `conversation`, `device` | Which memory could not be read. A read that answers several scopes at once says this once per scope it could not answer, so nothing renders empty unreported. |
| `error` | `CLASS_NAME` | yes | no |  |  |

### `memory_unwritable`

A change an agent asked for could not be stored, so nothing was changed. The
write path's own event, beside the read path's above: the two fail differently
and answer differently. A read that fails is contained (the agent remembers
nothing of that scope this round and the reply happens), while a write that
fails is a sanitized refusal the model reads out, so this is where an operator
learns what the database actually said, by class name and never by message.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.memory.store` at WARNING

```text
could not write %s memory for agent %s (%s); nothing was changed
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `scope` (`TOKEN`) | no | one of: `agent`, `conversation`, `device` |  |
| 2 | `agent` (`IDENTIFIER`) | no |  |  |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `event` | `ID` | yes | no | the `event_name` syntax |  |
| `agent` | `IDENTIFIER` | yes | no |  | The agent that was acting, by its configured name. |
| `scope` | `TOKEN` | yes | no | one of: `agent`, `conversation`, `device` | Which memory the refused write was for. |
| `error` | `CLASS_NAME` | yes | no |  |  |

### `memory_cleanup_failed`

State and held facts belonging to conversations that are gone could not be
removed. Agent-free on purpose, beside the two events above: the boot sweep
and a session's own teardown act for no agent and on no scope, so neither of
the other two could report this honestly. Nothing is lost by a failure here
except the space, and the next sweep takes what this one did not.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.memory.store` at WARNING

```text
could not remove the memory of conversations that are gone (%s); the next sweep takes what this one did not
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `error` (`CLASS_NAME`) | no |  |  |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `event` | `ID` | yes | no | the `event_name` syntax |  |
| `error` | `CLASS_NAME` | yes | no |  | The class of the failure, and the whole of what this event carries. There is no agent and no scope, because what this answers for is the memory of threads nobody owns any more. |

### `filler_disabled`

Filler synthesis failed for one agent, so latency masking is off for it.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.filler` at WARNING

```text
agent %s: filler synthesis failed, latency masking is off for this agent (%s)
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `event` | `ID` | yes | no | the `event_name` syntax |  |
| `agent` | `IDENTIFIER` | yes | no |  |  |
| `error` | `CLASS_NAME` | yes | no |  |  |

### `fallback_degraded`

The phrase a failed reply says would not synthesize for one agent, so its
failed turns are shown on the display and not spoken. Separate from
`filler_disabled`, whose meaning is that latency masking is off.

#### Variant 1: `vinga_server.filler` at WARNING

```text
agent %s: the failure phrase would not synthesize, its failed replies are shown and not spoken (%s)
```

| # | Argument | Nullable | Constraint | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `error` | `CLASS_NAME` | yes | no |  | The class of what the voice or its transport raised, `TimeoutError` where the synthesis outran the build's own deadline. The class alone, like every other failure vocabulary here: a message from near a response body is not this server's to write down. |
