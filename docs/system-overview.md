# System overview

A maintained explanation of one conversation turn, from the wake word
to the spoken reply. It follows the two hand-drawn diagrams the
project is described with and explains each concept, and the problem
that concept solves, before using its acronym, so it can be read
start to finish by somebody who has never run vinga. It describes the
system as it is today and changes when the pipeline does.

[`glossary.md`](glossary.md) is the same vocabulary arranged for
looking one thing up; this page is the tour.
[`architecture/README.md`](architecture/README.md) is the index for
the pages that say what a change to any of this is held to.

## The overview

[![vinga architecture overview](architecture/diagrams/excalidraw/vinga-architecture-overview.png)](architecture/diagrams/excalidraw/vinga-architecture-overview.excalidraw)

The picture the root README leads with: a human talks to an ESP32-S3 device, the device talks to your vinga-server over one WebSocket, and the server talks to whatever providers you configured. Everything that follows is that loop, zoomed in.

## One conversation turn, in detail

[![vinga conversation flow, detailed](architecture/diagrams/excalidraw/vinga-conversation-flow-detailed.png)](architecture/diagrams/excalidraw/vinga-conversation-flow-detailed.excalidraw)

The diagram reads top to bottom as one turn of conversation: flow 1 (blue) carries your speech up to the language model, flow 2 (green) carries its reply back down to your ears. Dashed gray lines are the control and tool messages riding the same connection. Before the first turn, the device has already fetched its configuration from the server's over-the-air (OTA) endpoint, opened the WebSocket with the token that response contained, and agreed on audio codecs in a `hello` exchange; that setup is the thin note at the top of the diagram, and the [xiaozhi research notes](xiaozhi-notes.md) document it key by key.

### Flow 1: from your voice to the language model

1. **You speak.** The turn starts with a wake word (spotted on the device by Espressif's [ESP-SR](https://github.com/espressif/esp-sr) models) or a button press; either opens the session and starts the microphone.

2. **The microphone captures audio, minus the assistant's own voice.** A speaker and a microphone centimeters apart mean the microphone hears whatever the assistant is saying, and a naive assistant would answer itself in an endless loop. The fix is [acoustic echo cancellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_suppression_and_cancellation) (AEC): subtracting the known playback signal from what the microphone picks up. On the [boards vinga targets](https://docs.waveshare.com/ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.54) this runs in hardware (an ES7210 microphone ADC paired with an ES8311 codec), which is what makes barge-in (interrupting the assistant mid-reply) possible at all.

3. **The device compresses the audio with Opus.** Raw 16-bit audio at 16 kHz is 256 kbit/s, wasteful over Wi-Fi from a small embedded chip. [Opus](https://opus-codec.org/) is an open codec designed for live speech: it compresses each 60 millisecond frame to a few hundred bytes with imperceptible loss and almost no delay.

4. **The server receives frames and decodes them.** The device and server share one [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API), a connection that starts as an ordinary HTTP request and then stays open for both sides to send at any time; that gives the device a single outbound connection (friendly to home routers) carrying binary audio and JSON control messages alike. The server decodes each Opus frame back to [pulse-code modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation) (PCM), the plain stream of samples every later stage works on.

5. **The server notices when you stop talking.** There is no push-to-talk button in a natural conversation, so the server must hear the difference between a pause for breath and the end of your sentence. That is voice activity detection (VAD): [Silero VAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad), a small local neural network, scores each chunk as speech or silence, and an endpointer on top waits for enough trailing silence to call the utterance finished. It also trims the recording down to the speech plus a short pre-roll, so the long silences of an open microphone never reach the next step.

6. **The utterance becomes text.** Automatic speech recognition (ASR) turns the trimmed audio into a transcript. vinga's local engine is [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper), a reimplementation of OpenAI's [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) model that runs quickly on ordinary CPUs, and the same stage runs through the OpenAI transcription API instead if you configure it, which on a small CPU is both quicker and better at a noisy room in a language that is not English. The transcript is also sent back to the device (the dashed `stt text` line), so the display can show what was understood.

7. **The language model decides what to say and do.** The transcript, the active agent's prompt, what it remembers and what this conversation is keeping, and a list of tools go to a large language model (LLM), local via [Ollama](https://ollama.com) or remote (Anthropic or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint). A model alone can only produce text, so tools are how it acts: the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) is an open standard for offering such tools, and vinga wires it in on both sides. External MCP servers add whatever capabilities you attach; the device itself offers its own controls (volume, brightness, screen) as MCP tools over the same WebSocket. The server loops: the model asks for tools, results go back in, until the model settles on a reply, which it streams out sentence by sentence.

### Flow 2: from the model's words to your ears

8. **Each sentence is spoken as soon as it exists.** Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis runs per sentence, locally with [Piper](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl) or through OpenAI or ElevenLabs for a better voice, so the first sentence is playing while the model is still writing the rest. Waiting for the full reply first would add seconds of dead air to every answer. The next sentence is then synthesized while the current one is still playing: frames are paced to realtime, so a sentence takes about as long to send as it does to hear, and synthesizing only after the previous one finished put every sentence's time to first byte on the speaker as silence (measured at 617 ms and 520 ms between the sentences of a three-sentence reply, and heard on a board as hiccups in the assistant's voice). One kind of sentence is not spoken: a model that writes a tool call into its own prose instead of issuing it would have the JSON read out loud, so a sentence shaped like a call to a tool this reply offered is dropped, with an event saying it happened.

9. **The audio is resampled, re-encoded, and paced.** The voice's sample rate is converted to the 24 kHz the server announced in the `hello` exchange, encoded back into Opus frames, and sent at playback speed rather than as fast as the network allows. Pacing matters because the device has a small playback buffer: flooding it would overflow memory, and a reply queued seconds ahead could not be cut short cleanly when you barge in.

10. **The device plays the reply.** Frames are decoded back to samples and fed to the speaker through the same audio codec chip from step 2, while the display shows each sentence as it starts (the `tts sentence_start` messages).

11. **You hear the answer, and the loop closes.** After the final `tts stop` message the device starts listening again on its own (auto mode), so the next thing you say begins the next turn at step 1 with no wake word needed. A realtime device never stopped listening in the first place, and a conversation nobody comes back to is hung up after `server.limits.idle_timeout_s` (two minutes by default), because otherwise its microphone would stream to the server for the whole hour the session is allowed.

## What this diagram leaves out

It draws one turn going well, which is what makes it readable, and two things that matter are therefore not on it. Both have their own picture in [`architecture/diagrams/plantuml/`](architecture/diagrams/plantuml/).

**Interrupting a reply.** Speaking while the assistant is speaking cancels it, but only on evidence that you really did speak: acoustics alone, mid-reply, are as often the room or the assistant's own voice leaking past the echo cancellation. Too little speech is a noise blip and is ignored, the moment right after playback starts is ignored, and anything else pauses the reply and asks the transcriber before deciding, so a wrong guess costs one transcription rather than the answer. The branches are drawn in [`barge-in-decision`](architecture/diagrams/plantuml/vinga-barge-in-decision.png).

**Which of these stages leaves your machine.** Every provider declares how far session data given to it travels (`host`, `network` or `internet`), `server.data_boundary` declares the outermost reach you allow, and a build that exceeds it is refused at startup, so a server that starts is one that stays inside the boundary you drew. Some types cannot answer for themselves, an OpenAI-compatible base URL being equally a vendor, a model server on your network, or an Ollama on localhost, and those must say so explicitly. [`architecture-overview`](architecture/diagrams/plantuml/vinga-architecture-overview.png) colours every provider by that declaration.
