# Xiaozhi research notes

What this project learned by reading the upstream xiaozhi projects,
running them, and putting boards in front of them. It is the entry
point for anything about the wire between a device and vinga-server.

The page carries four kinds of statement and labels each one, because
they age differently:

- **Maintained protocol facts** describe the exchange as it stands and
  are corrected when it moves. Every section below opens by saying
  that it is one of these, and [Upstream
  currency](#upstream-currency) says what "as it stands" was last read
  against.
- **Dated field observations** are what a board actually did on a named
  day. They keep their date wherever they appear, including inside a
  maintained section, where they are the evidence that a fact is more
  than a reading of the sources.
- **Historical upstream research** is what an upstream project looked
  like when it was read. It is not chased as upstream moves: it is
  labeled with when it was read, and kept because it is why vinga is
  shaped the way it is.
- **Licensing evidence** is what the upstream licenses say, and what
  they cost vinga.

Board-specific behavior is not here. What a particular board does, and
every procedure that involves the board in front of you, is in
[the board guides](devices/README.md), which say of every fact whether
it was read from the board support code, verified in hands-on use, or
not verified at all. This page keeps what every board running the
upstream firmware shares, and links the guides for the rest.

Reference clones of the two upstream repositories live in `vendor/`,
which is not committed. Recreate them with:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32.git vendor/xiaozhi-esp32
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-esp32-server.git vendor/xiaozhi-esp32-server
```

## On this page

- [Upstream currency](#upstream-currency): which upstream commits and
  which firmware versions the maintained facts were last read against.
- [The firmware, and the one URL that points it at a
  server](#the-firmware-and-the-one-url-that-points-it-at-a-server):
  what every board running upstream's firmware does, and the single
  entry that decides which server it talks to.
- [The device to server protocol](#the-device-to-server-protocol): the
  OTA check-in, the 6-digit activation ceremony, and the WebSocket
  channel with its message types.
- [What running stock firmware costs the
  server](#what-running-stock-firmware-costs-the-server): each
  constraint the device puts on the server, and the one capability the
  board already has that vinga does not use yet.
- [The upstream server, as read on
  2026-08-01](#the-upstream-server-as-read-on-2026-08-01): the
  reference deployment the first end-to-end demo ran on.
- [Licensing notes](#licensing-notes): what the upstream licenses cost
  vinga.

## Upstream currency

**What the maintained sections were last read against.** The protocol
facts on this page come from the vendored upstream sources rather than
from a published specification, so which revision they were read from
is part of the fact:

| Upstream project | Commit | Clone read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [78/xiaozhi-esp32](https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32) | `dd99da00dc4c89ed4ab07fcec038c03f13f4de50` | 2026-07-29 |
| [xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-esp32-server](https://github.com/xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-esp32-server) | `de45f73efdd24e9343427a56b5d22f857b6bb7a7` | 2026-07-28 |

The firmware actually observed on boards is the other half, and the
half that matters more: **2.2.4**, the Waveshare factory image on the
AMOLED-2.16, and **2.4.0**, upstream's prebuilt image on the
Touch-LCD-1.54, both observed 2026-08-12/13.

Those two together are what "caught up to" means here, and the second
is the one the stock-firmware promise is read against:
[its version target](architecture/product-promises.md#stock-xiaozhi-firmware-is-the-compatibility-floor)
is the firmware running on boards in the field, not upstream's HEAD. A
newer upstream commit therefore does not by itself make this page
stale; a board in the field running something these sections were never
read against does.

Bump this section whenever the vendor clones are re-read or a new
firmware version is observed on a board, and say what moved with it.
Re-reading against a recorded commit takes a full clone: the shallow
clones above fetch today's HEAD and can check out nothing else, so
`git fetch --unshallow` first.

**You do not have to notice upstream moving on your own.**
[`upstream-watch.yaml`](upstream-watch.yaml) carries the same two
commits and dates in a shape a workflow can read, beside the exact
upstream paths these sections were read from, and the docs lane holds
the manifest and the table above to full agreement in both directions
(`scripts/upstream_watch.py check`), so bumping one without the other
turns the lane red rather than lying quietly. Every Monday,
[the drift workflow](../.github/workflows/upstream-drift.yml) diffs
those paths from each pinned commit to upstream's HEAD and to
upstream's latest release, and opens or updates one issue naming what
moved. The loop when one arrives: read the changed source in a clone,
update the sections here that are now wrong, bump the commit and the
date in both homes together, and adjust implementation and tests only
where the wire actually moved. A report can undercount, because only
the deletion side of a rename is visible to it, so it is a prompt to
re-read rather than a claim about everything that changed.

## The firmware, and the one URL that points it at a server

**Maintained protocol facts**, with the dated field observations that
are the evidence for two of them. This is what every board running
upstream's firmware does; which board does what is in
[the board guides](devices/README.md).

- Board support is compile-time: `main/boards/<vendor>/<board>/`,
  selected via Kconfig (`Xiaozhi Assistant → Board Type`), so which
  peripherals, buttons and wake word an image has is settled when it is
  built. The primary test board's directory is
  `waveshare/esp32-s3-touch-lcd-1.54`, and what that build turned out
  to contain is in [its guide](devices/waveshare-esp32-s3-touch-lcd-1.54.md).
- Mainline requires **ESP-IDF v6.0.x**; releases ship prebuilt merged binaries
  per board, flashable at offset `0x0`:
  `esptool.py --chip esp32s3 write_flash 0x0 merged-binary.bin`.
- **The only tie to a backend is the OTA URL.** Priority: NVS namespace
  `wifi`, key `ota_url`, falling back to compile-time `CONFIG_OTA_URL`
  (default `https://api.tenclass.net/xiaozhi/ota/`). Everything else
  (WebSocket URL, token, protocol version, firmware updates) is delivered by
  the OTA response and persisted to NVS.
- The captive portal (WiFi provisioning AP `Xiaozhi-XXXX`,
  `http://192.168.4.1`) may or may not have a **Custom OTA URL field**
  on its Advanced tab, and the presence is vendor-build-dependent, not
  a firmware-version threshold: the Waveshare factory image on the
  AMOLED-2.16 has the field at firmware 2.2.4, while stock 2.4.0 on
  the Touch-LCD-1.54 has none (both observed on hardware,
  2026-08-12/13; an earlier revision of this bullet inferred "added
  after v2.4.0" from those same boards, wrongly). Where the field
  exists, a board can be pointed at a backend with no USB cable at
  all. Where it is absent, or where a provisioned board offers no way
  back into its portal, the URL is written directly to NVS over USB,
  which is the route that works on every board:
  [the board guides' common page](devices/README.md#writing-the-servers-address-into-nvs)
  carries that procedure, and each guide says what its own board's
  portal was observed to carry.
- **The portal may save the URL without its trailing slash** (or the
  operator may type it that way), which is field-observed rather than
  hypothetical. The device then POSTs to the slashless path; a server
  that answers with a redirect, even a method-preserving 307, bricks the
  check-in loop, because the firmware's OTA HttpClient does not follow
  redirects: the board shows `code=307` and restarts over and over.
  vinga-server therefore serves the slashless spelling directly on every
  device-facing route. A device-facing endpoint can never rely on a
  redirect.
- **An HTTPS backend needs no firmware certificate work.** The firmware
  trusts the ESP-IDF certificate bundle and sets
  `CONFIG_MBEDTLS_CERTIFICATE_BUNDLE_CROSS_SIGNED_VERIFY=y`, which is
  exactly what a Let's Encrypt host needs today: the bundle carries
  `ISRG Root X1` and `X2` but not the newer `ISRG Root YR`, and such
  hosts serve `Root YR` cross-signed by `X1`, so the chain validates
  through the cross-sign. The boot log confirms it with
  `esp-x509-crt-bundle: Certificate validated`. Pin nothing: `X1` is the
  anchor that actually works, `Root YR` on its own is not self-signed and
  fails strict path building, and the leaf rotates roughly every 90 days.
- App logic lives in `main/application.cc`; protocol in `main/protocols/`;
  device exposes its own MCP tools (volume, brightness, etc.) to the server
  over the conversation channel.
- What a particular board does with all of this, its buttons, its wake
  word, its display and its own voice commands, is in
  [the board guides](devices/README.md), and so are the procedures
  that involve the board in front of you: writing NVS over USB,
  resetting it, and reading its boot log back.

## The device to server protocol

**Maintained protocol facts.** This is the half vinga-server
implements, and the vocabulary the rest of the documentation summarizes
rather than restates. The dated evidence that each part of it was seen
on real hardware is kept beside the fact it validates.

### The OTA check-in and what it answers

- Device POSTs system info to the OTA URL (headers `Device-Id` = MAC,
  `Client-Id` = UUID); response JSON contains `websocket {url, token,
  version}` (and/or `mqtt {...}`), optional `firmware {version, url}` and
  optional `activation {...}` (omit it and no activation is ever required).
- **A successful OTA check does not mean the device is authorised.** A
  board the configuration resolves to no agent still gets `200 OK`, with
  `websocket.token` empty; the refusal comes later, at the WebSocket
  handshake, as a `403` logged as `auth_rejected` with reason
  `no_token`. An empty token is therefore the signal to read, and it has
  more than one meaning. It comes with an `activation` section when the
  board is genuinely unbound and a code may be offered, and the board
  shows a claim code: that is a device waiting to be claimed rather than
  one turned away. It comes without one when the ceremony is turned off,
  when the device is bound to an agent this process has not loaded yet
  and is waiting for a reload, when the server could not read the
  bindings authoritatively, or when the pending table declined the offer
  because it is at capacity or has spent its budget for new codes. So an
  empty token with no activation section is not by itself a hard
  provisioning error: it is the reply saying no agent is reachable yet,
  and which of those it is, the server's own log for the check-in says.
  A board that provisions perfectly and then never speaks is one of
  them, not a network fault. One POST from a
  laptop, sending the board's MAC as `Device-Id` and its UUID as
  `Client-Id`, answers the question before touching the hardware. A
  plain `GET` on the same URL returns a human-readable line naming the
  WebSocket URL, which smoke-tests routing without revealing anything.
- **vinga's reply says why the token is empty, in a top-level `access`
  field.** The empty token has two meanings the wire could not tell
  apart: a board this deployment has nothing to admit, and a board that
  is admitted on a deployment issuing no device tokens at all
  (`server.auth.enabled: false`, where the server mints nothing for
  anyone). The field is a closed set of three, decided where the token
  is: `token` means admitted and the non-empty token beside it is the
  credential, `open` means admitted with no credential to hand out, and
  `denied` means not admitted, which is why there is nothing in the
  token. Being unresolved wins over the auth setting: a board no agent
  covers reads `denied` whether authentication is on or off.
- **The `access` field is additive at the one boundary stock firmware
  ignores.** The parser reads exactly `activation`, `mqtt`,
  `websocket`, `server_time` and `firmware`
  ([the ceremony section below](#activation-the-6-digit-code-ceremony)
  records that), so an unknown top-level key reaches no firmware code
  path at all, which is the same ground the `server` block has stood on
  since it was added. It is deliberately not a member of `websocket`:
  the firmware writes every key of that object into NVS (observed on
  hardware, `token` arriving and being persisted between the two
  milestones of
  [the v1 implementation record](plans/2026-08-02-samtal-server-v1-implementation.md)),
  so a key added there would leave a stray NVS entry on every stock
  board instead of being invisible. The compatibility floor is
  therefore untouched, and no board's behavior changes.
- **Probing the WebSocket route with `curl` needs `--http1.1`.** curl
  negotiates HTTP/2 by default, where a WebSocket upgrade is not a valid
  handshake, so the request arrives as an ordinary `GET` and a WS-only
  route correctly answers `404`, which reads like a broken route. With
  `--http1.1` and the `Connection`, `Upgrade` and `Sec-WebSocket-*`
  headers, a `403` from an unauthenticated probe is the success signal:
  the route is alive and device auth is enforced.

### Activation, the 6-digit code ceremony

How an unbound device gets claimed on xiaozhi.me, reconstructed from the
vendored sources because no public spec exists: `main/ota.cc` cites a
Feishu wiki that answers 404 anonymously, and upstream's `docs/` never
describes the OTA HTTP exchange. Device side: `main/ota.cc` and
`main/application.cc` in `vendor/xiaozhi-esp32`; server side:
`OTAController.java` and `DeviceServiceImpl.java` in the manager-api of
`vendor/xiaozhi-esp32-server`. Issue #40 built vinga's onboarding on
this ceremony, and the operator's side of it is in
[the server README](../vinga-server/README.md#onboarding-a-device).

- The OTA response may carry an optional `activation {message, code,
  challenge, timeout_ms}` object. Omitting it means no activation is
  ever required and the device proceeds straight to the websocket.
  vinga-server offers the object to a device that is genuinely
  unbound: the ceremony has to be enabled, the binding view has to be
  authoritative rather than a fallback, the device has to resolve to no
  agent at all rather than to one this process has yet to load, and the
  pending table has to have room and budget for another code. A device
  that fails any of those is answered without an `activation` section,
  and with the empty token the previous section describes.
- When it is present, the device shows `message` on screen with the
  activation jingle and speaks `code` digit by digit, each digit an OGG
  clip from the firmware's compiled language assets
  (`Application::ShowActivationCode`). Upstream sets `message` to the
  frontend host, a newline, then the code, and the screen renders it
  exactly that way.
- The device then POSTs `<ota_url>/activate` with
  `{algorithm: "hmac-sha256", serial_number, challenge, hmac}`, the HMAC
  computed over `challenge` with an eFuse-burned key and announced with
  `Activation-Version: 2`. A board with no serial number burned, which
  is what consumer boards like ours are, sends `Activation-Version: 1`
  and a body of `{}`, so the server can identify the poll only by its
  `Device-Id` header; upstream's manager-api does exactly that and never
  reads the body. `202` means keep waiting, `200` means activated,
  anything else counts as a failure.
- **Send `challenge` or the poll is slow.** Without one the firmware
  fails `Activate()` immediately and waits 10 s between attempts instead
  of 3 s. Upstream sets `challenge` to the device's MAC.
- **A device waiting on activation re-checks OTA in a loop.** Activation
  is not a dead end: `Application::CheckNewVersion` polls `/activate` in
  bursts of ten, 3 s apart, then re-runs the whole OTA check and
  re-displays whatever code the fresh response carries, indefinitely.
  Binding a device server-side therefore takes effect within seconds,
  with no power cycle and no button press; only a bound, idle board
  waits for its next boot to re-check OTA. Two consequences: codes can
  be short-lived on the server, since the device fetches and displays a
  fresh one within a couple of minutes, and losing server-side pending
  state costs nothing but a changed number on the screen.
- **The whole ceremony is validated on hardware against vinga-server**
  (2026-08-13, the issue #40 checkpoint), on both available boards. The
  Waveshare factory AMOLED-2.16 (firmware 2.2.4), given the short
  onboarding URL through its portal, showed the server host over a
  6-digit code, polled in the documented 3-second bursts, and went from
  code-on-screen to activated in 36 seconds after a live
  `config device pending claim`, with no server restart, no power cycle, and no
  button press. The stock-firmware Touch-LCD-1.54 (2.4.0), pointed at
  the same server over USB-written NVS, ran the identical ceremony
  through the restart flow (its agent was created after boot). The one
  firmware behavior the sdk-based test simulator could not have shown is
  the redirect intolerance recorded
  [in the firmware section above](#the-firmware-and-the-one-url-that-points-it-at-a-server);
  `vinga simulator check-in` can, and does. It follows no redirect at
  all, answers one of its own fixed refusals when it meets one, and its
  own lane asserts that exactly one request is made and the target is
  never fetched (issue #248).
- **The OTA response cannot set the device language.** The parser reads
  exactly `activation`, `mqtt`, `websocket`, `server_time` and
  `firmware`; screen chrome, jingle and digit voices are all compiled
  language assets. The device announces its build language in
  `Accept-Language` (`zh-CN` factory, `en-US` ours), so a server can
  localize `message`, but a factory board titles the screen 激活设备 and
  speaks Chinese digits regardless. The one runtime lever is the
  user-only MCP tool `self.assets.set_download_url` plus a reboot, which
  swaps the whole assets bundle and requires hosting one per board.

### The WebSocket channel and its messages

- WebSocket handshake headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`,
  `Protocol-Version`, `Device-Id`, `Client-Id`. Then a JSON `hello` exchange;
  audio is binary **Opus**, device→server 16 kHz mono 60 ms frames,
  server→device at the rate announced in the server hello (24 kHz typical).
- JSON control message types: `hello`, `listen`, `abort`, `tts`, `stt`, `llm`
  (emotion), `mcp` (tool calls), `system`, `alert`. Documented upstream in
  `docs/websocket.md` and `docs/mcp-protocol.md`.

## What running stock firmware costs the server

**Maintained protocol facts**, read as constraints rather than as
mechanics: each entry below is what the device settles, so the server
cannot.

vinga-server implements the server half of the protocol above and changes
nothing about it: the device runs stock xiaozhi firmware, `vinga-esp32/`
ships no code, and every message named above is upstream's. That is the
right trade for v1, and it has a price, paid in server-side machinery that
exists only because the device cannot be asked to behave differently.

This is the list to revisit when the device side is tackled (the
`esp_xiaozhi` component spike under "Later versions" in the v1 plan). Each
entry is a constraint, the workaround it forced, and what owning the
firmware would change. Add to it whenever a feature turns out to be shaped
by the device rather than by the problem.

### The device owns the listening mode, and the server cannot change it

`listen` travels device to server only; vinga-server sends none. Manual
mode ends an utterance with `listen stop`, auto mode re-arms itself after
each `tts stop`, and realtime mode asks once and then streams for the rest
of the connection. Barge-in therefore exists only in realtime, because
that is the only mode where the microphone is still open during a reply.
Owning the firmware would let the mode be a server or per-agent decision
instead of a build-time one.

### Nothing in the firmware ever closes a realtime audio channel

This is the whole reason for `server.limits.idle_timeout_s`. Worse, the
board cannot sleep while an audio channel is open (`CanEnterSleepMode`
refuses), so an abandoned realtime conversation keeps the microphone
streaming and the board awake until a server-side timer guesses that
nobody is there. A device that noticed its own silence would not need the
guess.

### Echo cancellation is the device's, and its quality is invisible from here

How much of the assistant's own voice survives the board's AEC and reaches
the endpointer is the number the entire barge-in gate stack is built
around: the minimum speech floor, the transcribe-to-confirm step, and
the `server.barge_in` off switch for boards that leak too much. It is also why session capture exists at all,
since no test lane can produce the number. Owning the firmware means the
playback reference is available on the device side, where cancelling it is
a signal-processing problem rather than a statistical one.

### The wake word is spotted on the chip, and the server takes no part in it

ESP-SR decides on-device, and no server work changes that: the planned
English wake word (`wn9_hiesp`) is a custom build and nothing else. The
detection itself is not something the server can hear, tune, or substitute
for. What the server does get is an after-the-fact report: the firmware
sends `listen` `detect` with the fired word in `text`, which vinga-server
currently debug-logs (`device/session.py`) and does not retain.

The trigger audio is a build-time question rather than a settled one.
`CONFIG_SEND_WAKE_WORD_DATA` defaults to `y` for AFE wake-word builds, and
under it `ContinueWakeWordInvoke` drains an Opus-encoded copy of the audio
cached around the trigger into `SendAudio` before sending the `detect`
report, so such a build does send that span as the conversation's first
audio. None of our three boards overrides the flag, and nothing has been
observed on the wire from the prebuilt images we actually run, so what
those do is open (#112). Earlier versions of this note said flatly that
the audio never reaches the server; that was read from the wrong end of
this code path.

### The device is the MCP server, and discovery is a race

Tools are fetched in a background task after `hello`, deliberately so,
because the conversation must not wait on a board that may never answer. A
first utterance that beats discovery runs without device tools; if
discovery completes, later utterances have them, possibly only from the
second one on. A device that declared its tools in `hello` would remove
the race.

### The OTA URL is the only field an operator can put a secret into

Every request identifies the board by `Device-Id`, a MAC printed on the
box and broadcast in the clear in every Wi-Fi frame, and a stock board can
present no other credential at its first OTA call. The token issuer
therefore has to be protected by the URL path itself, which is why
`server.ota_path` carries a long random segment and why onboarding means
typing a secret into a captive portal. Activation (#40) changes what an
unknown MAC receives, a claim code instead of an empty token, but a bound
MAC presented by anyone still gets that device's real token, so the path
stays load-bearing. Owning the firmware would let a device hold a real
per-device credential instead.

### We serve configuration through OTA and never images

That is our choice rather than a limit: the update channel is fully
built on the device and merely unused. See the next section, which is the
one entry here that is an unclaimed capability instead of a constraint.

### Updating firmware over the air, once there is firmware

The endpoint vinga-server calls "the OTA endpoint" is an over-the-air
*update* endpoint that xiaozhi also overloads for configuration. We use
only the configuration half. Everything needed for the other half is
already on the board, so the work when the device side starts is signing
and hosting, not plumbing.

- **The partition layout is already A/B.** `partitions/v2/16m.csv`, the
  default for our board, carries `otadata` plus `ota_0` and `ota_1` at
  about 4 MB each (and an 8 MB `assets` SPIFFS). Nothing has to be
  reflashed later to enable updates; the slots are sitting there unused.

- **Path one, at boot.** If the OTA reply carries `firmware: {version,
  url}`, the device compares the offered version against its own
  (`ParseVersion` splits on dots into integers) and, when the offer is
  newer, closes the audio channel and streams the URL straight into the
  inactive slot through `esp_ota_begin`/`write`/`end`, sets the boot
  partition and reboots. `firmware.force = 1` skips the comparison
  entirely, which is the downgrade and re-pin escape hatch. The version it
  compares against is `app_desc->version`, the ESP-IDF project version
  baked into the app descriptor, so shipping an update means bumping that.

- **Path two, mid-session.** The device registers an
  `self.upgrade_firmware(url)` MCP tool, so an upgrade can be triggered
  over the live WebSocket without waiting for a reboot. It is registered
  with `AddUserOnlyTool`, and `GetToolsList` takes a separate
  `list_user_only_tools` flag, so it is kept out of the tool list handed to
  the model: the server can call it deliberately, but no language model can
  decide to reflash a board. Preserve that separation.

- **Rollback is already enabled.** `CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE=y`
  is in `sdkconfig.defaults`, and a new image is marked valid only once it
  has booted *and* completed an OTA check that found nothing newer
  (`esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback`). An image that cannot get that
  far is rolled back by the bootloader, so a bad build costs a reboot
  rather than a bricked board.

- **Nothing verifies who built the image.** This is the part to get right
  before anything ships. `esp_ota_end` validates the image's integrity, its
  checksum and magic, and says nothing about its authorship; the download
  is a plain HTTP GET into the OTA partition, and neither Secure Boot nor
  flash encryption appears in `sdkconfig.defaults`. It matters more here
  than in most projects because the endpoint that would name the firmware
  URL is also the token issuer, and is deliberately protected by nothing
  but a secret path segment. Anyone who can reach it and answer with a
  `firmware.url` owns the board. Serve images over HTTPS at the very least,
  and turn on Secure Boot v2 with signed images before a device leaves a
  network you control.

## The upstream server, as read on 2026-08-01

**Historical upstream research**, and the one section here whose facts
are deliberately not kept current. This is
xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-esp32-server as it was read and run for the first
end-to-end demo on 2026-08-01, at the commit
[Upstream currency](#upstream-currency) records. vinga-server is a
separate implementation and does not track it, so nothing here is
corrected as that project moves: it is kept because it is the reference
deployment vinga's own behavior was first checked against, and because
its configuration is what a reader comparing the two projects meets.

- Components: `xiaozhi-server` (Python 3.10, the conversation core) plus an
  optional Java/Vue management console. **Python-only mode needs no database
  and has no login/activation**: devices just connect; that's our reference
  mode, and the management layer is what vinga-server will reimplement in
  Python if needed.
- Ports: WebSocket **8000** (`ws://host:8000/xiaozhi/v1/`), HTTP **8003**
  (OTA `http://host:8003/xiaozhi/ota/`, vision API).
- Config: base `config.yaml` + override file `data/.config.yaml` (only your
  overrides). Providers are chosen via `selected_module` (VAD/ASR/LLM/VLLM/
  TTS/Memory/Intent), each mapping to a named entry whose `type` selects the
  implementation in `core/providers/`.
- Working zero-key local pipeline: `SileroVAD` + `FunASR` (SenseVoiceSmall,
  ~936 MB `model.pt` from ModelScope into `models/SenseVoiceSmall/`) +
  `OllamaLLM` + `EdgeTTS`. There is an OpenAI-compatible provider
  (`type: openai` with `base_url`) but no native Anthropic provider.
- **Language gotcha**: the reply language is injected into the system prompt
  from `TTS.<selected>.language` and **defaults to Chinese**
  (`core/utils/prompt_manager.py`). Set `language: English` on the TTS entry
  or the LLM answers in Chinese and an English-only TTS voice returns
  "No audio was received".
- Runtime deps: Python 3.10, `libopus`, `ffmpeg`. The pinned `vosk` package
  has no macOS arm64 wheel; safe to skip (it's an alternative ASR backend).
- Working demo override (`data/.config.yaml`):

  ```yaml
  server:
    websocket: ws://<server-ip>:8000/xiaozhi/v1/
  selected_module:
    VAD: SileroVAD
    ASR: FunASR
    LLM: OllamaLLM
    TTS: EdgeTTS
    Memory: nomem
    Intent: function_call

- Server-side MCP: external MCP servers are attached via
  `data/.mcp_server_settings.json` (stdio/SSE/streamable-http); their tools
  join the LLM's function-calling list alongside the device's own MCP tools.

## Licensing notes

**Licensing evidence.** What the upstream licenses say, and what they
cost vinga. The rules this project holds itself to as a result are in
[`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

- Both upstream repos are MIT; reuse, modification, and redistribution are
  fine with attribution and preserved license notices
  (see `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`).
- `edge-tts` (Python package) is GPL-3.0 and uses an unofficial Microsoft
  endpoint; keep TTS engines as optional pluggable providers.
- ESP-SR wake-word models are Espressif-licensed (Espressif chips only);
  model weights (SenseVoice, Silero) are downloaded at deploy time, not
  redistributed.
