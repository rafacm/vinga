"""Text nobody vouched for, on its way to a surface a command keeps.

Two kinds of string reach these commands from outside: a URL an operator
typed, which is where a credential gets pasted by mistake, and a string
some far side returned, which is whatever answered at an address.
Neither has been vouched for by anything, and both end up on a terminal,
in a shell history and in whatever collects stderr.

One door each. `parsed_url` splits a URL with the parser's own failures
kept inside the boundary, since both of them put the text they refused
into the exception. `shown_url` is the only way a parsed address may be
displayed: the host rebuilt from the parsed parts, the userinfo gone and
the secret-shaped query parameters taken out, so a refusal that names an
address is never the thing that publishes its credential. `printable`
bounds far-side text and replaces what a terminal would obey.

The display door is one function rather than strip primitives a caller
has to order correctly, which is what makes this the rule's home instead
of a toolbox beside it. What counts as a credential in a query is not
restated here either: `config/models.py` already owns that rule for the
configuration's own URL-shaped values (`is_url_credential_parameter`,
which `url_credential` and `without_url_credential` read too), and
`shown_url` filters through the same predicate.

Two callers, the `config/cli` package and `doctor.py`, and neither may
other: the doctor must not pull the config CLI's machinery, and the
config CLI reading URL hygiene out of the doctor would be backwards. So
this lives beside the failure type `parsed_url` raises and the predicate
it reuses, and stays light enough for a top-level command to import.
