"""Pydantic models for the vinga-server configuration.

The configuration has two halves. `FileConfig` is the half the YAML file
holds, `server`, with the VINGA_ environment overrides
pydantic-settings gives it. The domain half (providers, mcp_servers,
agent_defaults, agents, devices, default_agent) lives in the database
and is written with `vinga-server config`. `Config` is the composition
of the two, which is what the server boots from and what every call site
reads.

Secrets are referenced by environment variable name (for example
api_key_env, or a $VAR value in an MCP server's env and headers), never
written inline; the other form is a value encrypted in the database,
which no model here ever carries.

    MCP servers, prompt fragments, agent defaults, agents, devices, the
    default agent) is the domain half, which lives in the database this
    section names and is written through the configuration API.

    Read once at start and never re-read by a running process: the port,
    the paths, the limits, the barge-in tuning and the storage switches
    are what one server is serving until the next one starts. That is
    the line between the two halves. A change here is a restart; a
    change to the domain half is an apply, except for the two kinds a
    running server re-reads as a device asks for them, `devices` and
    `default_agent`, which reach a board at its next check-in with
    nothing asked of the server at all.

    `VINGA_SERVER__<PATH>`, with `__` joining the nesting

    beats file beats these defaults. The `database` section is the one

    variable it is read from, and the two values that are
    environment-only, the database password and the whole database URL,
    have no key on any of these models at all.

    Two path fields are the exception to that, and they are worth
    naming because they do not look like secrets. A stock board can
    present no credential at its first OTA call, so the token issuer is
    protected by its own path: `ota_path` carries a long random segment
    on a publicly exposed deployment, and `onboarding.key` pins the
    short segment serving the same endpoint. Both are as sensitive as
    what they stand in front of, which is why neither is ever quoted

    a declared field descends into its own annotation, a position

    is not said. A location in the STORED half addresses rows the

    The name is a heuristic over words, and the words are common enough
    in a request parameter that a key can look like a credential while
    holding something no credential can be written as. `max_tokens` was
    the first one found (#277) and got a name of its own; the endpoint
    that named the second, `max_completion_tokens`, is what says a
    per-name list was the wrong shape (#444). The `openai_compatible`
    type exists so that an option this repository never heard of travels
    rather than being refused, and a rule that has to learn each vendor's
    vocabulary before a cap can be written refuses the ones nobody has
    added yet.

    So the value decides, and it decides in the direction that keeps the
    guard: a number and a bool cannot be pasted-credential shaped, and
    everything else could be. A string is the case the guard is for. A
    mapping or a list is refused as well rather than walked into,
    because a credential nested under a key already named `token` is a
    credential the walk would have to be right about twice, and None,
    because a key that holds nothing is not a cap either.

    The name is asked one more thing first, and it is what keeps this
    from being a wider hole than it looks. A secret-shaped key is two
    shapes, not one: a key NAMING a credential slot, where the value is
    the paste, and a key that IS the paste, since a key is as good a
    place to put one and better at hiding there. The value can only
    speak for the first. So the guard steps aside only for a key spelled
    the way a request parameter is spelled, a bare word of letters,
    digits and underscores; a key carrying anything else is not a
    parameter name at all and stays refused whatever it holds.

    What it costs is named rather than left implicit: a credential that
    fits in a number, a numeric PIN or a six-digit code, is now written
    inline rather than refused. The heuristic never protected those
    well (`pin` and `code` are not among its words), what protects a
    credential here is the `_env` reference and the secret store beside
    it, and what the guard is really for is the pasted string a display

    server's stderr as it fails to start and in a text-format log line,
    and nothing between the composition and that stream escapes
    anything. `store._check_addressable` refuses a control character in
    a name for exactly that reason, that it "does not survive a header
    or a log line intact", and it refuses it at WRITE time only, so a
    row written before the rule still boots and still names itself in
    every one of those sentences (#414).

    Escaped rather than replaced or withheld, because of what the
    operator holding the sentence has to do next. Such a row is
    reachable: a control character percent-encodes losslessly, unlike
    the slash a credential-bearing name holds, so `%1b` in a path
    fetches, renames and deletes it. `\\x1b` is the byte, so the
    sentence is a recipe for addressing the row; a fixed mark is not,
    and it would print two different broken names alike. Withholding
    the name leaves an operator who cannot see which row is broken.

    Only the control characters are escaped, which is what keeps every
    lawful name byte-identical: this is the identity function on
    anything a write would accept today, exactly as the credential strip
    is. The backslash is deliberately NOT escaped beside them, so a
    lawful name holding the six characters `\\x1b` renders like a name
    holding the one character. That ambiguity is a reading of two names
    rather than an addressing of either, and closing it would change how
    every lawful name holding a backslash is printed, which is the
    property the whole chain exists to keep.

    Stripped first and escaped second, and the order is the rule rather
    than a preference. `url_credential` reads the value exactly as the
    write path read it; escaping first would put backslashes into a
    value that is about to be parsed as a URL, and `urlsplit` deletes a
    tab, a carriage return and a newline before it looks for the `@`, so
    `https:/<CR>/user:password@host/x` is a credential to the strip and
    is not one once the carriage return has been spelled out. The cost
    of this order is measured and small: a control character INSIDE a
    credential-bearing name can be swallowed by that same deletion, and
    such a name is being rewritten anyway.

    Not on the DISPLAY surfaces, which is the line this rule stops at
    and the one thing measured before it was drawn. A view hands an
    identity back as a document key, and what writes that document
    escapes a control character already and losslessly: JSON as
    `\\u001b`, YAML as `\\e`, and the CLI's terminal door as `?`
    (`printing.printable`). Escaping there would mangle rather than
    render, because a read is a fragment a write of it accepts back: an
    export naming `bad\\x1bname` imports as a lawful eleven-character
    agent that nothing meant, where today the same export is refused by

    `declared` says whether `name` is a field this model declares, and
    it decides what the refusal may say. A declared field is a name this
    repository chose, so it is named: `api_key_env` is printed, and the

    every key under it, so the refusal names the closed fragment the key

# `ı`. The consequence is the one `store.py` promises cannot happen: the

# it applies no context-sensitive rule, which is exactly why that

# the database's are not the same number, so a character assigned by one
# and not the other folds differently until both catch up. It is bounded
