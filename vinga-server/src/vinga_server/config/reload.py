"""Applying the stored configuration to a running server.

One verb, and it is the configuration's rather than any one kind's
(#191). The MCP reload proved the shape: a prepare phase that can only
refuse, then a swap of what new work binds to. What is here is that
shape generalized, so that a caller asks for the stored configuration to
be applied and never for one half of it, and the halves that converge at
different moments say so in the answer rather than in the caller's head.

Two phases and one exclusion.

Preparation re-reads the stored domain half, composes the world this
server may actually serve, validates it whole, builds the engines that
world speaks through, synthesizes the filled pauses it needs and builds
every MCP manager it names, with nothing running touched: a failure
anywhere in it is a refusal that changed nothing. Application then puts
the world in place, generation first and MCP install after it, inside
one instability window, so a reader either sees the world before or the
world after and never a mixture.

Building the engines is where a preparation spends its time and its
memory, and it is deliberately paid before anything can refuse: the
boundary rule can only be checked on a built provider, so a refused apply
has loaded a model to find out. That is the price of the promise that a
refusal touched nothing running, and it is paid only for what actually
moved: an entry whose definition and stored credential are what they
were is carried into the new world as the object it already was, so an
edit to a prompt reloads nothing at all.

The one thing preparation does that cannot refuse is the synthesis. A
filled pause is a latency mask, so an agent whose voice will not speak
applies with no clip and runs with the mask off, exactly as a boot
leaves it; a posture where a text-to-speech hiccup blocked a prompt fix
would invert which of the two matters.

The world a generation serves is the stored domain half WHOLE, which is
the part worth reading twice, because it was not always so. Through the
milestones that built this, the candidate was an overlay: the previous
generation's configuration with only the slices this server could really
apply replaced from the store, because the agent set, `agent_defaults`
and each agent's choice of provider entry were start-bound and the
effective-value helpers inherit through exactly those. Nothing in the
domain half is start-bound now, so the overlay is gone and the candidate
is what the store describes, composed onto this process's own server
section by the read and validated whole by that same read. What is left
of the old boundary is the file half, which a reload never re-reads: the
port, the directories, the limits, and everything else `server` holds.

The exception types a refusal raises ARE the contract with the API:
`ReloadInProgressError` and `DatabaseBusyError` are the 409s, a
`ConfigError` is the 422, and a `StorageError` is the 500. The sentences
they carry name configuration locations, and the composition root
replaces the ones composed over stored state with fixed ones before they
reach a response body; the type is what survives, because the type is
what decides the status.

Deletion test: inlined into `api.py` the route would learn what a reload
is made of, which is the one thing that module refuses to know; inlined
into `app.py` the composition root would grow a second responsibility
beside wiring.

        Two phases, and only the second touches anything running.
        Preparation re-reads the stored half, composes and validates the
        world this server may serve, synthesizes its filled pauses and
        builds every MCP manager that world needs; any failure there (a
        stored snapshot that will not compose, an unset `$VAR`, a
        credential that will not decrypt, an entry `server.data_boundary`
        forbids) refuses with the generation
        and the managers exactly as they were. Application then swaps the
        generation and stops, starts and installs the MCP world, so what
        a new activation binds moves at one instant rather than across
        one.

        A synthesis that fails is the one failure in there that is not a
        refusal: the world applies with no clip for that agent and the
        answer names it, because a filled pause is a mask and a reload
        that refused over one would hold back everything else it was
        asked to apply.

        Being unreachable is not a preparation failure, which is the
        boot's rule carried over: a candidate that connects to nothing
        applies as a down manager with its reason on the status surface,
        revived when a session that would use it opens.

        One at a time. A second apply while one is running is refused
        rather than queued, because it would carry a configuration read
        later than the first one's into a world the first one is halfway
        through changing.

        The second phase finishes whatever happens to the caller. A
        client that disconnects cancels the handler awaiting this, and a
        cancellation landing between the generation swap and the MCP
        install would leave a server serving one half of each world with
        the exclusion released as though the apply were done. So the
        apply runs in a task of its own behind a shield: cancelling the
        request cancels the waiting, and the world still arrives in one
        piece.

        The preparation is behind a shield of its own, and for a
        different reason. Nothing it does can leave a half-changed
        world, but its re-read runs in a worker thread, and a thread
        cannot be cancelled: a client that disconnects during it leaves
        it holding the database's write lock for as long as it takes.
        Releasing the exclusion there would let the next apply start a
        read against a lock the last one still holds, and answer a
        caller who did nothing wrong that the database is busy. So both
        halves are owned tasks, and the exclusion is held until
        whichever of them is still running has finished.
