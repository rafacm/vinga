"""The `vinga-server config` command group: a client of the API.

The grammar is the one it has always had, one noun per entity kind, YAML
fragments as the write payload; what changed underneath is that a
command is now a request to the configuration API rather than a write
into the database. Nothing here decides anything about the
configuration: parsing, validation, reference checks, existence and
secret handling all live in the repository, which the API mounts, so a
refusal reads the same whichever way it was reached. The API carries the
repository's sentence in `detail` and this prints `detail`, unchanged.

Nothing plaintext is ever an argument: a secret arrives on stdin (not
echoed when the terminal is interactive) or from a named environment
variable, because arguments land in shell history and in the process
list. It then crosses the connection in a request body, which is why the
transport policy below is a refusal rather than a recommendation: the
bearer token rides on every request and grants everything the API can
do, so a plain http:// connection to anything but a loopback address is
not made at all.

There is no second way in. Every command that touches the domain
configuration is a request, so this module opens no database, loads no
encryption key and knows nothing about how a row is stored. A
deployment whose server will not start is recovered by booting one on
an empty database and importing a kept `export`, which is the procedure
`docs/reference/cli.md` writes out; surgical access to the rows
themselves is ordinary SQL and not this grammar's business.

One command stands outside all of this, because onboarding a board
happens before there is anything to configure. `ota-url` derives the
string a person types into a captive portal from the file half and the
environment, and contacts nothing whatsoever. It is one of the two
commands here that need the server half installed, `openapi` being the
other; both answer one fixed sentence when it is not. What answers on that URL
is a question for `vinga-server doctor`, which since #244 is a command
of its own: diagnosing an endpoint is not a configuration concern, and
what the two share is where the URL comes from, which is
`onboarding.origin`.

Every failure leaves as a ConfigError printed to stderr with exit code
1, naming the location and the kind of failure without quoting the value
that caused it, and no traceback from pydantic, PyYAML, SQLAlchemy,
cryptography or httpx reaches the user.

#
# One constant and not the invocation, and that is load-bearing rather
# than tidy. `docgen._quoted` picks the commands it publishes as recipes
# by matching each example file's comment lines against this prefix, so
# a name that varied with the entry point would render an empty recipes
# region through one of them and turn the drift check red on an
# unrelated change. A generated document may no more vary with the
# invocation than with the terminal.
PROGRAM = entities.PROGRAM

# And the two entry points this grammar has, as the fixed string each of
# them prints in a live help page or usage line. A closed map from a
# known entry point to a written-down name: `argv[0]` is never read and
# never interpolated, so a hostile one has no surface here at all.
#
# `main` is reached one of two ways. The console script calls it with no
# arguments, which is the short spelling; `vinga-server config` hands it
# `sys.argv[2:]`, which is the spelling inside the image. Anything that
# calls it some third way gets the canonical constant.

# remember a number. It is the same string whichever way this was
# reached, because a version is a fact about the artifact.
DISTRIBUTION = "vinga-server"

# And what it says when there is no installed distribution to ask, which
# is a tree on `sys.path` with nothing installed from it. A fixed word

# "nothing was changed; run the command again" with a sentence that says
# nothing about what happened. So: a bounded connect, and a read with
# margin above the busy timeout.
CONNECT_TIMEOUT_S = 5.0
READ_TIMEOUT_S = 30.0

# What `apply` waits instead, because it is the one request whose
# server-side work is not a database call. The server's envelope is one
# MCP connect timeout plus one prompt-discovery deadline plus small
# change: stops run concurrently under a short bound, starts run
# concurrently under the connect timeout, and an entry that names
# published prompts spends one further bounded phase fetching them, so
# a slow server is reported down rather than waited for. This is
# comfortably above that, because a client that gave up on an install
# the server then carried out would recreate the exact ambiguity the
# whole feature exists to remove: nobody would know what is running.
APPLY_READ_TIMEOUT_S = 60.0

# And what `import` waits, which is the sentence above taken to its
# conclusion where no finite envelope exists.
#
# An import is one transaction, and the transaction loads the whole
# existing configuration and validates the whole resulting one, whose
# size nothing about the request bounds: the document may be small and
# the store it lands in large. So there is no number to derive. What a
# finite bound would buy is the exact thing every timeout here exists to
# prevent, a client that gave up on a write the server then committed,
# leaving nobody able to say what is stored.
#
# So the client waits for the answer, however long the transaction
# takes. The connect timeout stays bounded, because a server that is not
# there must still say so quickly, and the two bounds the server applies
# before it mutates anything (the document's entry count and its body
# size) are where an unbounded request is refused. What is left is
# transport death mid-wait, which is the exposure every write already
# has, and the recovery is the same: read the store back with `export`
# or `show`.
IMPORT_READ_TIMEOUT_S: float | None = None

# And what `events tail` waits, which is the same conclusion reached
# from the opposite direction.
#
# A read timeout bounds how long an answer may take to arrive. The event
# stream's answer never finishes arriving: it is the server saying what
# it is doing, and a deployment that is doing nothing at four in the
# morning is a stream with nothing on it, which is the reading an
# operator opened it for. Any finite number here would be a clock that
# ended a healthy tail and reported it as the server going away, which
# is the one thing this command's end-of-stream sentence must be able to
# mean.
#
# The keepalive is what makes that safe rather than merely intended: the
# stream writes a comment line on its own idle interval, so a connection
# that has genuinely died is a read that fails rather than a read that
# waits forever. The connect timeout stays bounded for the reason it
# always is, that a server which is not there must say so quickly.
STREAM_READ_TIMEOUT_S: float | None = None

# What the two long waits say while they are waiting, and how often.
#
# The waits are the two above that are not a database call: an import
# waits for a transaction whose length nothing bounds, and an apply
# waits up to a minute for a server to compose, validate and build a
# whole new world. Both are long enough that a terminal showing nothing
# is a terminal that looks hung, and neither has anything to print until
# it is answered.
#
# So a single line on stderr, and it is the interactive affordance the
# determinism practice licenses rather than an exception to it
# (`docs/architecture/cli-guide.md`). It is written only when stderr is
# a terminal, so a pipe, a redirect and a log file get the bytes they
# got before this existed, whole and in the order they got them. It
# re-presents only what the run reports anyway, which is that this
# client is waiting for the API's answer, so nothing is visible
# interactively that a script is not also told. And it carries no value
# of any kind: the no-leak posture applies to progress exactly as it
# applies to a refusal, so the document's path, an entry's name and the
# address reached are all as absent from it as they are from a sentence
# this module raises.
#
# `events tail` is deliberately not narrated. Its answer IS the wait,
# and a client drawing a line over a stream the server is writing to
# would be narrating the thing it is printing.

# What a cadence has to be, and it is a programmer's mistake rather than
# an operator's: no command line reaches this number, and the callers
# are this module and the tests that drive it faster than a second.
#
# Zero is the value the rule exists for. An event waited on with a
# timeout of zero answers at once, so a redraw loop asked for it would
# spin a core and rewrite the terminal as fast as the stream took it,
# which is the opposite of the thing being built.
PROGRESS_CADENCE_RULE = "the progress line's cadence has to be more than zero seconds"

# How long the way out waits for a redraw that is already inside the

# again, which is what flow control on one is, and the write that orders
# the two threads is then the write the command would be stuck behind.
# A command whose request has been answered must still be able to say
# so, so the wait is bounded and the erase is what is given up.
#
# A second is orders of magnitude above what a live stream takes and is

    the way a mistake in a fragment does: a sentence on stderr and exit
    1. --help still leaves through an exit 0 of its own, because asking
    for help is not a failure.

    An absent `argv` is the console script, which is the whole of what
    tells the two entry points apart here: `vinga-server` hands this
    `sys.argv[2:]` and the script hands it nothing. What that decides is
    one string in a help page, and nothing else.

    The `.env` file is read for this group rather than only in
    `vinga-server.main`, because both spellings have to behave
    identically and the console script never reaches that function. It
    is read where a command is about to run (`_Verbatim.invoke`) rather

    command needs no readable environment: a bare `vinga` gets its help
    page whatever the `.env` in the working directory is, which is the
    one moment a reader is least able to act on a sentence about a file
    they may not have written. Every command still runs with the
    environment loaded, because nothing here reads it earlier.

    It is read INSIDE the boundary, which is the whole of why the read
    is a function of the loader's rather than two library calls: a
    `.env` that will not open or will not decode is a failure on a path
    nobody validated, holding the variables an API token and the
    provider credentials come from, and outside the boundary it would
    leave as a traceback with those bytes on the exception. The read has
    moved down the call stack and not out of the boundary: it is still

    would bypass the sanitizing with it. `--help` is the one invocation
    that is not a failure, and it leaves through the exit code Click
    asked for, which is 0.

    Both answers are recorded inside their handler and raised after it,
    the way every other boundary in this module raises. A Click
    exception holds the context it was raised from and that context
    holds the argument list, so an exception raised while one is being
    handled would carry the whole command line as its `__context__` for
    anything walking the chain to find, which for this CLI is where a
    secret typed as an argument would be.

    That applies to `--help` as much as to a refusal, which is why the
    exit code is carried out of the arm rather than raised in it.
    `raise ... from None` sets `__suppress_context__`, which stops a
    traceback being printed and stops nothing else: the Typer exception
    is still on `__context__`, and this module's whole no-leak
    discipline is about what a chain walker finds rather than about what
    is displayed.

    the page the reader stopped at rather than the root's.

#
# `httpx` writes one line per request at INFO carrying the method, the
# URL and the status, and `logs.py` keeps that deliberately where it
# floors the vendor libraries: for every other caller in this server the
# URL it names says nothing that is not already public. For this one it
# is the address an operator typed, which is accepted with its query
# string whole and can carry `?token=<secret>` in it, so the record the
# library writes is the one surface `Address` exists to keep the
# credential off. A log record is retained in a way a terminal is not.
# `httpcore` traces the connection underneath and is held with it. The
# same two loggers, at the same level and for the same reason, as
# `doctor.py`'s probe; neither module may import the other, so the
# reason is stated in both rather than shared through one.
#
# Held for every request rather than only for an address whose two forms
# differ. The rule is then one rule: this command's own sentences are
# what an operator reads, and no request of its making narrates itself.

    request is in flight.

    **No redraw may land after the line is finished**, because it would
    sit on top of whatever printed next, which for a refused import is
    the one sentence the command has to say. **And the command may never
    wait without a bound to say so**, because a wait an operator sits
    through after the server has already answered is the very ambiguity
    the unbounded read timeout exists to prevent, arrived at from the
    other side.

    Those two are in tension on a stream that can stop accepting writes
    for ever, which a terminal under flow control really does. Holding
    the lock across the write is what orders the two threads, and it is
    therefore also what a wedged write would hold the command behind. So
    the second rule wins and the first is kept as far as it can be:

    - `finished` is set BEFORE anything else, and it is read inside the
      lock, so no redraw that has not already begun can ever write
      again. That half is absolute.
    - The erase then waits for the lock under a bound. Getting it means
      a redraw in flight has finished, so the erase is the last thing
      written and the line comes off. Not getting it means one write is
      wedged inside the stream, and the erase is abandoned rather than
      raced: the command returns, and if that terminal ever recovers the
      wedged redraw lands, with nothing after it that this line wrote.

    What the operator is left with in that case is the line still on the

    terminal and nowhere else.

    Two of this grammar's requests are answered after a wait an operator
    watches with nothing on the screen, and `PROGRESS_PHASE` above says
    which and why. Whether a given act is one of them is a fact on its
    row rather than a rule guessed here, because a bound and a wait
    worth narrating are different facts: every act waits, and a read
    bounded by the database's busy timeout is not a wait anybody sits
    through.

    Nothing at all happens off a terminal, and that is the whole of the
    licence this affordance runs under. The check is made once, on the
    way in, so a non-terminal run does not so much as construct the
    thread: there is no writer to be scheduled, no clock to be read, and
    no path by which a byte could reach a redirected stream.

    Three seams, all for tests and all read as None rather than as false
    values, because absent and zero are two different answers.
    `cadence_s` is how often the line is redrawn, so that a test can
    drive several redraws without waiting seconds for them; `clock` is
    where elapsed time comes from, so that a test can assert the number
    on the line moves rather than that something was drawn three times;
    `erase_wait_s` is how long the way out waits for a redraw that is
    inside the stream, so that a test can drive both sides of that bound
    without sitting through the real one. The clock's default is
    monotonic, because what is displayed is a duration and a wall clock
    stepping backwards mid-import would show one that ran backwards with
    it.

    A cadence at or below zero is refused where it is read: an event
    waited on for zero seconds answers at once, so a loop asked for it
    would spin a core and rewrite the terminal as fast as the stream
    took it. No command line reaches that number, so the refusal is a
    programmer's rather than one of this grammar's sentences. Zero is a
    coherent answer for the other bound and is not refused: it means do
    not wait at all for a wedged write, which is a thing a caller may
    honestly want.

    The first line is drawn here rather than by the writer, so that a
    wait shorter than one cadence still says what it is waiting for and
    still takes back what it said. That is the one place this can block
    on a terminal that has stopped accepting output, and it is left
    where it is deliberately: nothing has happened yet when it does, so
    there is no completed work going unreported, and it is the same
    block any command already has at its first write to such a stream.
    What must not happen is a command whose request has been answered
    unable to say so, and that is `finish`'s bound.

    Everything after the first line is the thread's, and the thread is a
    daemon that stops on the line's own event: an interpreter shutting
    down mid-wait is not held open by a line it was drawing, and the
    wait itself is bounded by the request's own timeout rather than by
    anything here.

    **A writer that cannot be started changes nothing about the
    command.** An interpreter out of thread stacks raises from `start`,
    and this catches it, takes the line it had already drawn back off
    the screen and runs the request with no narration at all. The
    affordance is best effort by nature, and the alternative is what
    this had before: a traceback out of a boundary that catches two
    exception classes, a line left standing, and a request never made
    over a progress line that could not be drawn.

    here would render a command addressing an entity that does not
    exist.

    `--` after the command's own words, and it is not decoration.
    Nothing about a name forbids a leading dash: the write path refuses
    a slash and a control character, and `--from-env` is a legal
    provider name that a secret write would otherwise read as an option
    and refuse. The marker is the shape an operator has to use to write
    such a name in the first place, so the exported command is the
    command they typed.

    The kind is read as the closed set of kinds that hold a secret, so a
    location naming one this client does not have meets the fixed

    The identity and the slot are the one thing in these renderings that
    is printed as written rather than through the display door. What
    this builds is a command an operator pastes to address the entity it
    names, and the door bounds at a hundred and twenty characters and
    replaces what it cannot print, so a location put through it would
    address a different entity or none.

    round: a location this client cannot render as written is one it
    does not render. `shlex.quote` is what makes a line safe to paste,
    and it is not what makes a line safe to READ: quoting keeps a
    newline, and a newline ends the `#` that makes this a comment, so
    the rest of the identity lands on a bare line of a YAML document
    whose own header says to import it. Every other unprintable
    character reaches the terminal as itself for the same reason.

    Refused whole, and not per character: the fixed sentence names
    neither the location nor what was in it, exactly as every other
    unreadable answer's does. The write path refuses a control character
    in a name, so nothing this API stored can meet this; what can is an

# What this client does about a boundary the API states
#
# The API says which boundary a write is waiting at, in tokens it
# publishes and never in a command (#386): what installs a stored
# configuration is a verb of a client's grammar, and a client is a
# program the server neither ships nor versions, so an image built
# before a rename would otherwise name a command the CLI beside it no
# longer has. This side owns the grammar, so this side names the
# command, and the spelling is then inside the command-spellings
# census's reach: a rename that missed it fails a test in this
# checkout rather than reaching an operator through an old image.
#
# One command crosses one of the four boundaries, and this is it. The
# other three are crossed by a device asking, a process starting and a
# server reading the store at boot, none of which is something a
# command of this grammar does. Written once and read by the three
# renderings below, so the diff's head and the advice under a write
# cannot come to spell it differently: that command is `vinga apply`.
INSTALLS = f"{PROGRAM} apply"

# What this client says about each set of boundaries a write can be
# waiting at, printed INSTEAD of the server's own sentence.
#
# Instead rather than under it (#426). The token is what travels, so
# whichever side can state the boundary states it once, and this side
# can: it knows what the set means and it knows the command that crosses
# it, while the server knows the first half only. Two lines said one
# thing twice, and the half an operator acts on was the second of them.
# So each line here stands alone, which is what it has to be able to do:
# it names the state first, because that is the half no compaction may
# cut, and the remedy after it.
#
# Keyed by the whole set rather than by a token, because what to say
# about `reload` and `check-in` together is one thing rather than two
# sentences in a row: the install crosses the first and the device
# crosses the second by itself.
#
# The keys are the sets there is something to run about, which is the
# whole of what a table like this may claim. A write waiting only at
# `check-in`, `restart` or `store-boot` is answered by the server's
# sentence and nothing else, because no command of this grammar crosses
# those and the server's words for them are already the whole answer; so
# is a set this client cannot name at all, which is what a boundary from
# a server newer than this one arrives as, the empty tuple `_declared`
# reads it down to. The rule either way is the same one: an unknown

    an operator's terminal, the first being the media type. A 200 whose
    body happens to parse as a JSON object is not this API's output, and
    this command prints an object's values, so "it parsed" is not a
    reason to print it.

    What is checked is the envelope, which is all this half can check: an
    event's own field names are the catalogue's, and the module that
    declares them is precisely what the client tier may not import. So an
    ordinary frame has to carry the three keys every streamed event
    carries, in the shapes the route publishes them in, and a `dropped`
    frame has to be its own small envelope and nothing else. A frame
    under any other name is not in the contract at all. Past that the
    event's own fields are rendered escaped, which is what keeps a
    hostile value to one line whatever it holds.

    The stamp is required to be a string rather than to be a stamp: what
    a string means is the renderer's question, and one that will not
    parse still prints as the value it is.

# What is answered before the environment is read
#
# `--version` has to succeed whatever else is wrong, and that is the
# whole of its contract: it is the question an operator asks when they
# are already comparing two halves of a deployment that disagree, which
# is exactly when the rest of a machine is not in a state to be relied
# on. A `.env` that will not decode is one such state, and reading it
# first made the one command that must always answer exit 1 with a
# sentence about a file it was never asked about.
#
# So the root position is recognized without a parser, and recognizing
# it is possible because the root's options are a closed set: everything
# before the first command word is either `--version`, one of the root
# flags, or one of the root options and its value. The sets are read off
# the built tree rather than listed, so an option added to the root
# joins them by being declared, and anything this does not recognize
# ends the scan and goes to the parser, which is the answer that was
# always there.
#
# `--config path --version` therefore answers, and `--config --version`
# does not, because there the word is the option's value and not the
# root's. That distinction is the reason this reads the parameters
# rather than searching the list for a string.
