"""What one server start reads: the file half, then the database.

The boot order is fixed and each step exists because of what would
otherwise fail later:

1. the file half, which is what says which database this is;
2. open and migrate that database, so a fresh instance is a current one
   with no init command to forget;
3. load the snapshot, models and stored secrets together;
4. verify every stored secret opens under the configured keys, before
   anything is built, so a missing or wrong key fails with the error
   naming the entity and the slot rather than a decryption traceback
   from the middle of provider construction;
5. compose the two halves into `Config` and validate the whole snapshot,
   which is the same last line of defence it has always been.

The engine is closed here: what this reads is a snapshot, so nothing
after this reads the database except `DeviceBindings`
(`vinga_server.device.bindings`), which reads only the `devices` and
`domain_settings` tables, through a read engine of its own, so that
binding a device applies at that device's next OTA check or connection,
and `reload_domain_config` below, which a running server runs on request
to apply what it can apply while it runs (`config/reload.py`).

Both exceptions are of the same shape, and it is the shape the boot
contract keeps: a named, bounded slice of the domain half, re-read
deliberately, with everything else still fixed at the moment this ran.
A CLI write to anything the reload does not apply is picked up at the
next start, by design.
