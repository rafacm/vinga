"""The envelope a stored secret is written in, and the keys behind it.

A stored secret value has exactly two forms. The first is an
environment reference, carried over verbatim from the YAML file:
`api_key_env: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in a provider's options, a `$VAR`
value in an MCP server's env or headers. Those stay the models'
business, they are not secrets themselves, and they display as
themselves. The second is ciphertext, written only by
`vinga-server config provider secret set` and its MCP sibling, stored
as the JSON object
`{"enc": "<fernet token>"}` in the entity row's `secrets` column under
the credential slot it fills.

Fernet authenticates a token but says nothing about where it belongs,
so the encrypted payload here is not the bare secret: it is a small
JSON document carrying the secret together with its canonical location
(entity kind, identity, slot). Decryption verifies that location
against the slot being read and refuses a mismatch, so a token copied
into another row (an attacker-controlled MCP server's headers, say)
does not decrypt into a credential it was never set for. The
consequence is deliberate: moving a secret means setting it again,
there is no copy path for ciphertext.

`VINGA_MASTER_KEY` holds one or more Fernet keys, comma-separated,
newest first, wrapped in MultiFernet: encryption always uses the
newest, decryption tries them in order. This release supports adding a
key, not retiring one. Until a re-encrypt command exists, only newly
written secrets use a new key, so every old key must stay in the
variable for as long as any token written under it is still stored.

Every failure here raises ConfigError with a message that names the
location and the kind of failure and never embeds the value, and every
raise cuts the exception chain: a JSON decode error carries the
document it failed on, which in this module is the decrypted plaintext.

    request should see it, and the secrets that went into it.

    Literal values pass through and a `$VAR` is read from the server's
    own environment, whether it is the whole value or sits inside a
    larger one. A slot with a stored secret
    takes precedence over the reference written for the same key,
    because a secret write is the later and more deliberate act, and a slot
    with no key in the entity at all is added: a fragment cannot carry
    the value, so requiring it to carry a placeholder would mean
    inventing an environment variable nobody sets.

    `server` is a stored name, and the location it goes into is what a
    boot prints when a reference names a variable nobody set, so it is
    composed by `entity_location` like every other location over a
    stored identity rather than joined to its section here (#414).
