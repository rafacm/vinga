"""What JSON can carry, and what it cannot.

The domain configuration is written in YAML and travels as JSON. YAML is
the wider language, so a file can hold values that have no written form
on the wire at all: `!!timestamp` produces a date, `!!binary` bytes and
`!!set` a set; an anchor can make a structure that contains itself; a
mapping key can be something other than a string; and NaN and the
infinities are floats no JSON encoder has a spelling for. A stored row
can hold the last of those and nothing else, because it came out of a
JSON column in the first place.

The policy lives in a module of its own because two callers apply it and
they are on opposite sides of the connection. The repository asks it of
every fragment it parses and of every row it reads back; the CLI asks it
of a fragment before that fragment travels as a request body, and of an
answer before that answer is written as a machine-readable document,
which are the places a mistake can still be met by a sentence rather
than by a stack trace. One rule and one wording, so whichever of them
sees the value first says the same thing about it. The alternative is
what the encoder does on its own: a TypeError, a ValueError or a
RecursionError with a traceback, in place of the sentence this file
exists to produce.

The two questions below are why the answer side reads the walk rather
than the guard: a fragment is refused with the section it was written
under, and an answer is refused with the fixed sentence of the act that
asked for it, so the caller there wants what the walk found and not the
sentence it would compose.

Nothing here quotes a value. A fragment refused by these rules is one
nothing has validated yet, so it may hold anything, including a
credential pasted a line early. Every message names where the value sits
and what kind of thing it is, and stops there.

# The whole of finding 1 of this PR's review round is here. A path built

# themselves, and a fragment refused by these rules is one nothing has
# validated: its keys are bytes a caller wrote. The mistake that
# produces this refusal most often is a credential pasted a line early,
# where the key beside it is the operator's own word for the credential.
#
# So a key is never said. What is said is that a field was reached, and
# how deep: a mapping step is this fixed word and a list step is its
# index, which is a structural fact about the shape rather than
# anything anybody typed. An operator counting the steps can find the

# is none in hand here: this check runs in front of validation, of a

# a whole document), and its whole job is to run before anything that
