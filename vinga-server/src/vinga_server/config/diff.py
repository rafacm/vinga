"""Which configuration kind takes effect at which boundary, and how two
configuration worlds are judged the same.

A running server holds one snapshot of the domain configuration and the
database holds another, and the question between them is what an
operator has written that is not in effect yet. Answering it needs two
facts that live nowhere else, which is what this module is: the regime
map, saying which kind converges at a restart, at a reload, or at
the next device check-in, and the comparison that decides an entity of
a kind has moved.

Equality is model inequality plus `SecretStore.fingerprint`, the opaque
per-entity mark that exists for exactly this question and can be asked
without a key. Nothing rendered, nothing masked and nothing decrypted
enters the comparison, so what comes out is entity names and closed
tokens by construction rather than by filtering: there is no value here
to leave out.

An agent layer is where model equality read literally is not the
question: one `mcp` grant has two spellings, so the comparison reads
that list as the grants it means (`_same_layer`). Rewriting an entry
from one form into the other changes nothing a reload would install,
and this module is the only place that has to know it, since a caller
asks whether an entity moved and not how it is written.

Changed means the stored state differs from the baseline, never that
something was written. An edit changed back before anyone looked
produces no diff, and a stored secret set again to the same plaintext
counts as different, because its ciphertext fingerprint moves even when
the value may not have. That is the store's own posture (rebuilding is
the safe direction to be wrong in) and it is the one the MCP reload's
`same_as` already takes.

Pure, and deliberately: both sides arrive composed, with the stored
secrets that were loaded beside them, so the tests build two worlds
from the support factories and nothing here opens a database. The MCP
half arrives composed too, as `McpPending`: the world a reload swaps is
the registry's to know, and its honest baseline is the generation that
is installed rather than the one this process booted on.

The answer is the shape the API sends, taken from `responses.py`, which
is where `McpReloadResult` lives for the same reason: what the answer
is made of is knowledge this module has, and a handler that had to
assemble it would be a second place that knew it. The tokens come from
there too, so the closed set a client reads out of the committed
document and the one this map is written in are one declaration.
