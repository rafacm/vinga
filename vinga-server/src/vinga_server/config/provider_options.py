"""The provider types: what builds each one, and what it accepts.

A provider entry's options are everything it carries beyond `type`,
`api_key_env` and `egress`, and until this module existed they were
read key by key inside the type's own builder: a ladder of
`OptionsReader` calls that named a rule per key, refused the leftovers,
and was invisible to every surface that documents the configuration.
A type that declares a model here states the same contract in one
place, and the write path, the builder, the JSON Schema and the
refusals all read it from that place (#88).

Three things live here and nothing else. The model CLASSES; the
`PROVIDER_TYPES` table, which is the one statement of which types exist,
where each one is built and which of them declares a model; and the
SANITIZER, the one function that turns a stage, a type and a mapping
into either a validated instance or a value-free refusal, so the write
path, the read-back and the build path consult one implementation rather
than three.

One topology, and everything derives from it: `providers/registry.py`
builds its registrations by resolving this table's factory names, the
documentation renders its per-type sections out of the same entries, and
the refusal that lists a stage's known types counts the same keys. There
is no second mapping to hold against this one and no test bridging two.

It weighs pydantic and `config.models` and nothing else: no provider
package, no engine, no database driver, no cryptography. A factory is
named rather than imported, which is what lets the topology live at an
address the documentation can afford. Three committed pins depend on
that, and each of them is a promise this repository makes about where
its code can run.

- The reference and the JSON Schema render from the models alone, in a
  child interpreter with no database and no key
  (`test_config_docgen.py`). They document these options now, so this
  module is on that path.
- Rendering the OpenAPI document loads no part of a conversation
  (`test_onboarding_import_weight.py`). It carries these models as
  components now.
- `vinga-server config` loads no engine. It prints these fields in the
  epilog of `set provider`, built when the command table is.

A home inside the provider package could satisfy none of the three: the
package's `__init__` re-exports the whole provider layer, so importing
one pydantic module from it pulls in the engine base classes, the
provider world and, through the secret store, cryptography. Hence this
address. What lives on the provider side is what genuinely runs there:
resolving a name into a callable, putting an entry's secrets in force,
constructing, and the reading of a validated instance inside a builder.

Field descriptions carry the example fragment's factual sentence, which
is what makes the schema and the reference say what the fragment says.
The narrative prose (the measurements, the tuning ladders, the reasons
behind a default) stays in the fragment under `examples/`, per the
standing documentation decision.
