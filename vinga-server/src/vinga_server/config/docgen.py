"""The domain configuration's documentation, rendered from the models.

Three renderings, one source. `Field(description=...)` on the domain
models is written once and read here as JSON Schema (what an API client
or an agent reads before writing a fragment), as the markdown reference
committed at `docs/reference/domain-config.md`, and as the `--help`
text of the commands that take a fragment. A description that is only
true in one of them cannot exist, which is the point.

What a model cannot carry, a kind's purpose and its notes and the
command that writes one, comes from the descriptor registry in
`entities.py`, which the other surfaces read as well. This module
renders those descriptors rather than keeping a second copy of them, so
prose that is only true in the documentation cannot exist either.

A fourth rendering has a different source: the configuration API's
OpenAPI document comes from that application's routes, committed at
`docs/reference/api-openapi.json` under the same regenerate-and-diff
check. It lives here because it is documentation, and because these
commands are the ones a documentation lane runs.

Everything here is deterministic: no timestamps, no set iteration, and
the field order is the models' own declaration order. CI regenerates
the committed reference and diffs it byte for byte, so anything that
varied between two runs would turn the lane red on an unrelated change.

Read-only, and deliberately so: nothing in this module opens the
database, reads a configuration file, or needs an encryption key. The
commands in front of it are usable on a machine that has none of those.

Importing this module no longer reaches the repository either, which is
a narrower claim than it sounds and is worth stating exactly. The
whole-domain model used to be declared in `store.py`, so this module's
import list pulled SQLAlchemy and cryptography in to reach one class;
it is declared in `models.py` now and this imports it from there. The
`vinga-server config` commands still pay for both, because `cli.py`
imports three pure helpers from `store.py` (the transportability check,
the apply location and the identity splitter) and so loads that module.
It opens no database with them: since #281 removed the break-glass path
the CLI holds no repository, no database opener and no key loader at
all. What the removed edge buys is that the markdown reference and the
JSON Schema
render with nothing loaded but the models and the registry;
`openapi()` is the deliberate exception and says so where it is
defined. `test_config_docgen.py` pins that in a child interpreter, so
the edge cannot come back unnoticed.

# The recipes
#
# A recipe is the sequence of commands one topic is written with, and
# every line of one is read out of an example file rather than typed
# beside it. The files already name their own commands: each fragment
# quotes the `set` that installs it, each preset quotes the `import`
# that writes it whole and the `apply` that installs what it wrote, and
# the ones that can hold a credential quote the `secret set` that fills
# the slot. Those quoted lines are the recipes,
# collected and grouped, so a recipe cannot come to name a file that
# moved or an entity name the file no longer uses.
#
# What this reads is a directory rather than the models, which is the
# one thing separating it from everything above.
#
# The build carries that directory into the package, so an installed
# artifact renders the same recipes a checkout does. The installed copy
# is what this prefers and a checkout is the fallback, which is the
# order that makes the shipped command the one being exercised: a wheel
# missing its fragments has to fail rather than quietly find the tree it
# was built from. Neither is a second home. `vinga-server/examples/` is
# the directory anybody edits, and the packaged copy is derived from it
# at build time the way the package itself is derived from `src/`.

# Where the example fragments are, in the two places an installation can
# put them: inside the package where the build put them, or beside
# `src/` where a checkout keeps them.
