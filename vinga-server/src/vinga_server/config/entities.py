"""The domain entities as data: one descriptor per kind.

An entity kind is spread across this package. It is a pydantic model, a
table and a row mapping, a masked view, a pair of API routes, a CLI
subcommand with its acknowledgement, and a section of the generated
reference, and until this module existed each of those surfaces knew
the entity by hand. The models stay the source of field truth. This is
the one place for what a model cannot carry: how the kind is addressed,
which surfaces it has, and the prose that is about the kind rather than
about any field of it.

Three tiers, because the package really has three. Five kinds are
written with a command of their own and read back through the API
(`EntityDescriptor`). Two shapes are only ever nested inside one of
those five, and so have no command, no route and no example file of
their own (`NestedShape`). Two domain-level fields are a mapping and a
scalar rather than an entity, written with their own verbs and read
without an envelope (`Setting`). One registry tuple per tier, in the
order the reference documents them.

Imports the models, the wire vocabulary and the standard library, and
nothing else, deliberately: every consumer sits above this, so a
descriptor stays readable by the one that renders documentation on a
machine with no database, no encryption key and no FastAPI, which is
exactly what `docgen` is. `responses` is on that list because a notice
carries the boundaries it announces as the tokens the API publishes,
and it imports pydantic and nothing of this server, which is the
property `test_cli_import_weight.py` holds it to.

Every fact is declared here, in the entry a reader meets the kind at,
and nothing is installed onto a descriptor afterwards. That is what the
frozen dataclass says and, since #210's fourth milestone, what it means:
there is no `fill`, no import-time mutation, and therefore no order the
modules above have to be imported in for a descriptor to be whole.

Which is possible because the facts are data or prose, and only ever
those: the three vocabularies a kind is addressed in (its route, its key
in the configuration document, its table), whether it has a delete,
whether stored secrets can hang on it, which of its keys carry a
credential, what a read or a delete of an entry that is not there
answers, and when a write of it takes effect. Behavior is not a fact
about a kind. A row mapping is written in terms of the repository's own
helpers, a masked body in terms of the masking rules, a route in terms
of FastAPI, and each of those lives with the code it is written in,
where its caller can see it and its signature can be honest.

# It cannot borrow `BINDING_UNSERVED_NOTICE`. That sentence is about one
# binding, written for the verb that writes one, and a rename may have
# moved several bindings and the default agent, none of which the

# it says the references rather than the binding.
#
# And it says a device that RESOLVES to the agent rather than one bound

# agent covers the devices that have no binding of their own, so a
# rename that moved the default alone moved the reference of precisely
# the devices that are not bound to the agent, and a sentence naming a
# bound device would be false of every device it was about. One
# sentence for both arms, because a caller cannot act on the difference:
# what is waiting is the same install either way.
#
# And which arm a rename lands on is decided by what its transaction
# rewrote rather than by what the running server is serving, which is
# where it differs from the binding above. `_binding_notice` asks
# whether this server already serves the named agent, and for a bind
# that question is sound; for a rename it is not, because a server may
# be serving an agent under the new name and it will not be this one. A
