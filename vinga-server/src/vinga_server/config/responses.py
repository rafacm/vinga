"""The shapes the configuration API answers and accepts.

Pydantic models, in a module that imports pydantic and nothing else,
which is the whole reason they are not in `api.py`. Two surfaces know
these shapes and only one of them may pay for FastAPI: the API declares
them as its response models, and the CLI renders an answer it received
over HTTP by validating it against the shape the API said it would send
rather than against a hand-kept list of the keys it expects. The CLI
must not import the API for it: `config schema` and `config reference`
would then pay for FastAPI on their way to printing a document that has
nothing to do with it.

"Nothing else" is why one description below writes the mask out as a
literal rather than reading `secrets.MASK`: this module sits under
`entities`, which sits under `loader`, which is what `secrets` imports,
so the import that would derive it is a cycle. The two are held equal
from the outside instead, by the pin in `test_api_openapi.py` that looks
for the constant in the rendered document, which is the byte a client
reads and the one that must not drift.

Beside the models, and for the same reason, the three runtime surfaces
the API is handed: the protocol a status read is taken through, and the
shapes of the callables the generalized reload is applied by and the
stored-versus-running comparison is read through. All three are stated
in typing and these models, which is what lets a route say what it was
handed without the module that renders the document loading the MCP SDK
to find out.

Every model forbids extra keys, so a field that is answered is a field
that was declared. The descriptions are the document's prose, written
for whoever reads the contract rather than the code, and they are
committed bytes: `docs/reference/api-openapi.json` carries them, and
the drift check compares them.

# What the metrics namespace answers
#
# The third reading of the same rows, and the one that answers about
# days rather than about a session or a thread: the named aggregates
# `conversations/views.py` declares, served to the readers who are not
# SQL clients. An analyst with psql reads the views directly and needs
# none of this.
#
# Here for the reason the shapes above are here: the CLI is the client
# and renders an answer by validating it against the shape the API said
# it would send, and a CLI that imported the routes to find out would
# import FastAPI, SQLAlchemy and the whole store with it.
#
# Nothing here restates a view. What a view is, column by column, is
# declared once in `conversations/views.py`, and these shapes carry that
# declaration through to a caller rather than describing it a second
# time: a column is a row of the matrix, and the caveats are the prose
# the registry declares.


# How a window may be grouped, which is a closed set the request is held
# to and the document publishes. One home for both: the route refuses
# anything that is not in this tuple and the shape below is typed from
# it, so a grouping cannot be servable without being documented.
#
# One token today. The per-device breakdown is a sibling view per
# declaration and arrives with the migration that adds them (#440 M3);
# until those relations exist there is nothing a second token could be
# answered from, and a vocabulary that always refused would be worse
# than one that grew.
