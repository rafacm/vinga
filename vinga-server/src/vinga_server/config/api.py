"""The configuration REST API: one sub-application, mounted at /api.

A second FastAPI instance rather than a router on the device-facing
app, for three reasons. The committed OpenAPI document is then exactly
the admin surface, with the device endpoints structurally absent from
it, while the main app keeps publishing no schema at all. The token
gate is a property of the mount instead of something each new route
decorator could forget. And `local_only` stays one sentence in
`app.py`: this is control plane, it accepts inbound requests and sends
nothing anywhere, so it needs no egress declaration.

Nothing here decides anything about the configuration. The repository
(`store.py`) validates fragments, checks references, decides what
exists and keeps secrets write-only; `views.py` decides what a read may
show. A handler that restated any of that would be the bug. What this
module owns is transport: the token, the path an entity is addressed
by, the status code a refusal maps to, and the shape of a body.

The shapes themselves are one module below, in `responses.py`, which
imports pydantic and nothing else. What a read answers is knowledge the
CLI needs too, and the CLI must not import FastAPI to get it.

One namespace here is not configuration at all. The conversation
store's reads (`/sessions`) are registered from `conversations/api.py`,
where their route functions and their response models live, because
what they answer is that store's business and not this one's. The
namespace is `sessions` and the store is `conversations` deliberately:
what these three reads answer is one connection episode and the turns
inside it, and the thread that spans several of them is a different
entity with a namespace of its own. They are registered on this application so that the gate,
the sanitized handlers and the committed document cover them by
construction, which is the whole reason a route belongs on this mount
rather than on an application of its own.

The gate is ASGI middleware, not a dependency, because a dependency
only runs for a matched route: an unmatched path inside /api would
answer 404 to an unauthenticated caller, which leaks which routes exist
and breaks "the namespace is gated" as a property. Enforcement being
middleware is also why the bearer scheme is stated explicitly in the
document below rather than falling out of a security dependency.

Nothing logs the token, a request body, or an Authorization header.

# The pending table, imported like anything else since issue #143 split
# the onboarding package. It used to be a forward reference, because the
# module that held the table also held a router over the OTA handlers,
# and so pulled the websocket session and everything a conversation
# needs.
#
# What naming it costs now, stated exactly rather than as "nothing":
# `pending.py` itself reads only the standard library, but reaching it
# runs the package's `__init__`, which also loads `keys`, `origin` and
# `unbound`, and `unbound` names the device bindings view, which brings
# SQLAlchemy and the configuration store. Accepted, and cheaply: this
# module imports `open_database` just above, so SQLAlchemy is already
# here whatever the pending table does. The line that matters
# is the conversation stack, and that is the line
# `tests/unit/test_onboarding_import_weight.py` holds, against
# `document()` itself rather than against the import alone.
#
# The MCP registry was deferred here too, for the same reason and with
# more force: it imports the SDK's clients and this project's provider
# layer, none of which rendering a document has any business loading. It
# is not named anywhere any more. What the routes are handed is
# `McpStatusSource` and `ConfigReloader` from `responses.py`, which say what
# this application asks of a running server out of typing and the
# response models, so the annotations resolve at import and the
# constraint holds by construction.

    request, so a deployment that forgot the variable is refused at boot
    instead of at the first call.

    `loaded_agents` answers which agents the server around this
    application can be asked for, which is what a device write's
    acknowledgement needs in order to say whether the write is live: a
    binding to an agent this server is not serving waits for the reload

    apply moves the answer while the process runs (#191). None is the
    honest answer for an application built without a server around it,
    which can serve no agent at all and answers every write with the
    sentence that says so.

    `pending` is the serving app's table of devices showing activation
    codes, shared rather than copied: the OTA endpoint writes it and the
    claim route reads it, and they are the same object or the ceremony
    does not work. An application built without a server gets a table of
    its own, which is empty and stays empty, so every code is unknown.

    `mcp_servers` are that server's live MCP managers, shared for the
    same reason: the status read reports what is running, and a copy
    would report what was running once. None is the honest answer for an
    application built without a server, and the read answers with an
    empty object.

    `reload` applies the stored configuration to the running server: the
    world new work binds and the MCP managers that serve it. A callable
    rather than the pieces it needs, because what it closes over is the
    composition root's business: the generation holder, the registry,
    and where the blocking half of the re-read runs. None is the honest
    answer for an application without a server, and the route refuses
    with 503 rather than pretending to have applied something.

    `snapshot_only` says that the server around this application was
    composed from a configuration handed to it rather than read from a
    store. False is the ordinary deployment and the default, because an
    application built without a server around it is not in that mode
    either: it has no server at all, which the fields above already say.
    What the mode changes is the three surfaces that would otherwise
    describe a store that describes nothing this server serves: the diff
    and the reload refuse, and a device or default-agent write says that
    what it wrote takes effect when a server boots from this store.

    `agent_prompt` assembles the prompt a session opening now as one
    agent would be sent, and answers None for an agent this server did
    not load. A callable for the reason the reload is one: what it
    closes over is the composition root's business again (the loaded
    configuration, the MCP registry and the memory store), and this
    application must not learn what a prompt is made of. None is the
    honest answer without a server, and the route answers 503.

    `config_diff` compares what the database holds with what the server
    around this application is serving. A callable for the reason the
    two above are: what it closes over is the world this process booted,
    the credentials loaded with it and the registry a reload replaces,
    and this application must not learn which kind of configuration
    converges where. None is the honest answer without a server, and the
    route answers 503 rather than reporting that nothing is pending.

    `identity` says which deployment this is: the build that is running
    and the URL a board is onboarded at. A composed value rather than a
    callable, for the reason `ApiRuntime` gives, and it arrives from the
    composition root for the reason the three callables do: it is
    derived from the device-auth secret and the origin this deployment
    names itself by, and this application must not learn where either of
    those comes from. None is the honest answer without a server, and
    the route answers 503, like the prompt read and the diff: identity
    has no honest empty.

        """Apply the stored configuration to this running server.

        The one action in this namespace, and the one way a stored
        change reaches a running server. What it applies is the whole
        domain half: the provider entries and the MCP entries with the
        secrets stored on them, the
        agents' effective `mcp` grant lists, the shared prompt
        fragments, the agents themselves and the `agent_defaults` layer
        under them, which carries the stage every agent that names none
        of its own inherits. An agent this installs is one a device can
        be bound to and reach at its next check-in; one it removes is
        one no session can be opened as from the moment this answers,
        while a conversation already talking as it finishes on the world
        it was built from.
        What is not here is the server section, which is this process's
        own file and is never re-read: the port, the directories, the
        limits. Nothing this API writes is in it.

        Nothing is swapped, stopped or started until the whole new world
        has been composed, validated and built, so a refusal (422) has
        changed nothing at all. A server that merely will not connect is
        not a refusal: it applies, and says `down` with its reason under
        `mcp.servers`, and is reconnected in the background when a
        session that would use it opens.

        Live conversations are not dropped, and when one meets the
        result depends on which half moved. The tools an agent may reach
        are snapshotted per reply, so a session picks those up on its
        next utterance; a call in flight on a server this stopped fails
        into the same error result a server dropping mid-call produces.
        Prompt text is assembled at an activation and cached for it, so
        an agent's own prompt, a fragment it includes and an entry's
        `instructions` alike reach a conversation at its
        next activation, which is a new session or an agent switch, and
        never a reply of one already running. Such an entry is reported `unchanged`
        under `mcp`, which is a statement about its connection: the
        connection is what did not change.

        The engines are the third half and the one that costs
        something. An entry whose definition and stored credential have
        not moved is carried into the new world as the object it already
        was, and is reported under `providers.reused`; one that was
        rewritten is built while the old one is still serving, reported
        under `providers.built`, and spoken through by the conversations
        that open after this answered. An engine a conversation is still
        speaking through is released when that conversation ends, so an
        apply that changes a local model briefly holds two of it.

        The world arrives in two steps, which is what makes the sentence
        above per half rather than per apply: what a new activation
        assembles from is put in place first, and the MCP managers are
        stopped, started and swapped after it, so a session activating
        between the two sees the new prompts with the old tool world for
        at most one utterance. Nothing else can interleave, because one
        apply runs at a time.

        One apply runs at a time: a concurrent one is refused with 409
        and has changed nothing, like a write that could not take the
        database's lock. A server serving a configuration that no store
        describes refuses with 409 as well, and says that starting from
        a store is what changes it.

        was emitted at, and `level`, its level's name. Those fields are

        Live and nothing but. There is no buffer behind this and no
        `since`: a stream carries what happens while it is open, and a
        reader that reconnects rejoins the present. What happened before
        is the conversation record's to answer, where a deployment
        enabled one.

        Three filters, applied as the events arrive. `device` takes a
        MAC in either separator and any case; `session` takes a
        session's uuid hex; `level` is a threshold, one of the four
        level names in any case, and defaults to INFO, which is what the
        retained log carries. An event that names no device or no
        session passes such a filter only when none is set, so a
        device-filtered tail is that board's traffic rather than the
        whole server's.

        A reader that falls behind loses its oldest events rather than
        slowing the server down, and is told: a `dropped` event carries
        how many went since the last delivery. An idle stream sends a
