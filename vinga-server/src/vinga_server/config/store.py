"""The repository over the domain tables: rows to models and back.

Every semantic decision about the domain configuration lives here and
not in the code that calls it: parsing a fragment through the existing
pydantic models, refusing a write that would leave a reference
unresolved, keeping stored secrets out of the models and out of entity
replacement. The CLI is one caller; the REST API will be the other, and
it is meant to mount this object behind HTTP rather than restate any of
it.

A write is one transaction. The engine takes the domain chain's
transaction-scoped advisory lock in its begin listener (see
`vinga_server.db`), so the lock is held before the snapshot is read:
two concurrent writers cannot each validate against the state before
the other's change and then persist over one another. A lock that does
not arrive inside the lock timeout fails the command with a retryable
error rather than half-applying it.

Reads run under the same transaction, and so take the same lock. A
read-only path was considered and left out: a load is a handful of
small selects, the only readers are a booting server and a CLI
invocation, and a second connection configuration would be a second
thing to keep true for a contention these never produce.

Write-time validation is the reference half only, and it runs against
`models.DomainConfig`, the seven domain sections without the file half
around them. Completeness (a runnable server's rules) belongs to boot,
which is what `models.Config` adds by subclassing that model: enforcing
it here would deadlock the natural creation order (providers, MCP
servers, agents, devices, and default_agent last), so the store
deliberately validates against the half rather than the whole.

        The act the delete-and-create workaround cannot make. A device
        binding and the default agent both refuse the delete half while
        they name the agent, so the workaround is six writes with the
        memory lost in the middle; this is one transaction over three
        schemas, and what comes out the other side keeps what the agent
        remembered, which boards are bound to it, whether it is the
        default, and the threads it can still be asked to resume.

        The four phases every write here runs. Both names are made
        usable outside the lock, so nothing a caller got wrong costs
        one; the rename is staged into the candidate domain state inside
        it; `check_references` is asked once about the state the rename
        would leave, which is what proves the bindings and the setting
        moved with the row; and the rows that moved are written.

        Then the two foreign schemas, in ascending key order and for the
        reason `db.advisory_key` states: this transaction opened on the
        domain engine, whose begin listener took key 1, so the record
        chain's 2 and the memory chain's 3 follow in that order and
        cannot close a cycle with the erasure that takes the same two.
        Each of them takes its own lock and checks its own destination
        inside this transaction, so a refusal there rolls the whole
        rename back and there is no half-renamed state to compensate
        for.

        And the sessions in flight are ordered against, rather than left
        to meet the moved rows on their own. A live session goes on
        talking as the name it opened with, so a turn it writes after
        this would be refused by the thread it is on, or would
        materialize that thread under a name nothing answers to. Both
        are closed by holding the conversation record's ordering lock
        across this transaction and the publication that follows it, and
        by publishing the pair of names to whichever writer is recording
        in this process: the writer holds the same lock from before it
        opens a durable transaction until that transaction has read what
        was published, so a rename and a marker are totally ordered and
        the second one sees all of the first.

        What is rewritten is every reference something reads to decide
        what happens next, and nothing else. The agents row's key, the
        device bindings that name it, the default agent, the facts filed
        under it, and the threads it owns. What is not touched is the
        record of what happened: a turn spoken last month was spoken by
        an agent whose name at the time was the old one, and the row
        saying so is evidence rather than a reference.

        Reversible by construction, which is what keeps it out of the
        confirmation table: `rename_agent(new, old)` puts everything
        back, including the memory and the threads, with information the
        operator has in the shell history of the command they just
        typed. The three destination refusals are what makes that true,
        because a rename that merged two pasts could not be told apart
        afterwards by any second rename.

        The old name is stripped and not checked for addressability. A
        row written before that rule still boots, still reads and is
        still deletable by membership, and it stays exactly as reachable
        after this verb as before it; the new name is checked, because

        The same phases a single write runs, over as many entries as the
        document holds: prepared outside the lock, staged into ONE
        candidate domain state inside it, checked ONCE against that
        state, and persisted. Checking once is the whole reason this is
        a repository verb rather than a loop of writes above it. A
        document that creates an agent and binds a device to it in the
        same breath passes through intermediate states no single write
        would accept, and a caller looping over the writes would either
        be refused halfway or leave the store half-applied, which is the
        outcome a document refused whole exists to rule out.

        Additive, and deliberately: a section or an entry the document
        does not name is untouched, an empty section adds nothing, and
        nothing here deletes. Pruning a store down to a document is a
        different verb with different stakes, secret deletion among
        them, and it is not this one. The one entry that removes
        something is `default_agent: null`, which is the explicit clear
        rather than an absence: leaving the key out says nothing about
        it at all.

        Idempotent by comparison rather than by blind rewrite. Each
        entry is compared with the one that is stored, and an entry
        describing the configuration that is already there is answered
        `unchanged` with no row written; `_stage_entity` says what that
        comparison is and what it deliberately is not. The same document
        applied twice is therefore a no-op by construction, and so is an
        exported document applied back onto the store it came from.

        Refused whole. Every entry is prepared, and then every entry is
        staged, before anything is raised, so an operator fixing a
        document meets all of its mistakes at once rather than one per
        attempt; the refusals are the sentences the single writes earn,
        under one line saying nothing was changed. Any refusal leaves
        the transaction unwritten, this repository's write being one
        transaction (see the module docstring).

        Between the two phases sits the one check a document has that a
        single write cannot: that no two of its entries address the same

    would answer a device differently from the boot that validated the

    Two differences from the reads above, both about where it runs. It
    takes the engine rather than a `ConfigStore`, because a device path
    reads through a read-only connection that never migrates and never
    takes the advisory lock (`db.read_engine`), and it reads two rows

    landing between them cannot produce a state that never existed. The

    to the other transport when it is PRESENT in `model_fields_set`, so a
    plain dump of a stdio entry would write `url: null, headers: {}`, and
    validating that body back would make every stdio server in the

    Serialization order is pydantic's declaration order. There is no
    sorted-keys option on `model_dump_json`, and declaration order is

    The forward consequence is worth stating where the choice is made: a

    which is the location, and the FIELD paths pydantic reported, which
    are the model's own vocabulary. Never the body: it holds values an
    operator wrote, and it is one string rather than a set of columns, so
    a sentence quoting "the row" would now quote the whole entity.

    That bound is what `validation_problems` already enforces, and it is

    (`tool_timeout_s` is `gt=0`, which NaN fails), but a provider's

    its model refuses) could not be deleted at all: the load failed on
    the way to removing the very thing that was failing, so the one row

    is rolled back with the row still there: the check has the same force
    it had, and the difference is only which state it is asked about.

    Deleting by identity is also what keeps a name no new write could
    create deletable, since nothing about the row has to be understood to

    When the remaining configuration cannot be read at all, the check is
    skipped rather than turned into a refusal, and the reason it is safe

    no longer does is hand the credential back: the display boundary
    strips one from every string it shows (`views._shown`), so a read of
    that entry answers with the address and not with what is in front of
    its host (#381).

    The refusal names the field and the rule and never the value: what

    percent-encode and decode losslessly; a control character does not
    survive a header or a log line intact and has no business in a name
    either.

    Write time only. The load path does not run this, so a row written
    before the rule still boots, still appears in a whole-configuration
    read, and is still deletable, which goes by membership rather than
    by this check. The refusal names the rule and the kind of character,

# the operator wrote is stored. A resubmission of that read therefore
