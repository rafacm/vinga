"""Load the file half of the configuration, and compose the whole one.

The path comes from the explicit argument, then the VINGA_CONFIG environment
variable; with neither set, defaults apply. Values follow pydantic-settings
source priority: VINGA_-prefixed environment variables (nested keys joined
with __, for example VINGA_SERVER__PORT) override the YAML file, which
overrides the field defaults.

The file holds `server`. The domain half lives in the database, so a
domain section left in the file, or a VINGA_ override for one, refuses
the boot naming where it moved and the command that writes it: a key
that quietly stopped applying is the trap this closes. A section that
retired rather than moved (`memory:`, since remembered facts joined the
database too) refuses through the same door and answers the other
question: what it configured is unconditional now.
Composition then puts the two halves together into `Config`, which is
what validates the whole snapshot the way it always has.
