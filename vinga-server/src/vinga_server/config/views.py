"""One masked view of the configuration, rendered two ways.

What a read shows is presentation, so it lives beside the callers rather
than in the repository: the API returns these dictionaries as JSON, and
the CLI renders the same ones as YAML with its comment lines underneath.
Two renderings of one view, so a mask that held in one and not the other
is not a thing that can happen.

The view is an envelope, never the bare entity. The entity's
model-shaped half is what a write accepts back, and by design it can
never carry ciphertext, so a bare entity would lose the one fact a
masked read exists to convey: which slots hold a stored secret, and what
each of them displaces. The CLI says that in comment lines; JSON has no
comments, so here it is structure:

    {"entity": {...}, "secrets": {"api_key": {"shadows": "api_key_env"}}}

Nothing here decides anything. Existence and precedence are the
repository's (`store.py`), the masking rule is `secrets.mask` plus the
secret-shaped-name predicate each kind's descriptor names, and this
module is the one place that rule is applied to an entity. It fails
closed: a value in a secret-bearing key that is not a syntactically
valid environment reference is masked, whatever it is, because a value
that got in another way may be a plaintext credential and the command an
operator runs to find that mistake must not be the one that prints it.

There are two rules, and the second one looks at what a string is
rather than at what it is called. A URL is the shape that carries a
credential under a key admitting to nothing, so what a display shows of
one is the address without it, whatever key it sits under and at
whatever depth (#381). It is asked of both halves of a pair: a mapping
keyed by whatever the caller wrote is the one place a rule about values
does not reach, so a key is stripped exactly as a value is (#408).
Both write paths refuse such a URL, and both refuse only at write time,
so this is what stands between a row that predates the rule and a
caller. `_shown` is where a value meets it and `_shown_mapping` is
where a key does; each says why it is the one site for its half.

What is displayed fails open, which is the other half of the same
decision (#176). A body is derived from the entry's model rather than
written key by key, so a field added to a model appears in `config show`
and in the whole-configuration document with nothing here to edit, and
appears masked if its name is secret-shaped. The alternative was
measured: a scratch field added during the descriptor work reached the
store, both APIs, the CLI and both generated references without anybody
touching them, and was invisible on every read, with no test failing for
it. Fail-open display and fail-closed masking are not in tension: the
walk that finds the new field is the walk that masks it, at every depth,
which is also how a nested credential inside an MCP server's env or
headers came to be masked (#171).

The record path is the opposite decision, deliberately, and
`provider_record` below says why.

# URL path segment, and refuses it AT WRITE TIME ONLY, which
# `store._check_addressable` says in as many words: a row written before
# that rule "still boots, still appears in a whole-configuration read,
# and is still deletable". It did appear, with the credential in it, in
# the document, in every listing, in the secret locations beside them
# and in the two projections that are a name rather than an entity
# (`default_agent` and a device's bindings).
#
# So every identity this module hands back goes through
# `_shown_identity`, and the identity-keyed maps go through
# `_shown_mapping`, which brings the collision rule with it.
#
# The addressability that costs, measured rather than assumed. A name
# this rule changes has `://` in it, because that is what
# `url_credential` looks for, so it holds slashes, and a name holding a
# slash is exactly what `_check_addressable` exists to refuse: such a
# row cannot be fetched, replaced or deleted over the API at all, raw or
# percent-encoded, and answers 404 either way. It was unaddressable
# before this and it is unaddressable after it, so what a sanitized
# display takes away is a spelling that never worked as a handle. The
# suffix rule below says the same thing from the other end: a shown key
# is a display artifact, not a guaranteed address. Widening the delete
# routes to accept a sanitized spelling would be a different feature and
# is deliberately not here; the way to reach such a row is the database

    and headers are mappings whose values were once masked only at the
    top (#171). All three are the same question asked at a different
    depth, and a walk that stops anywhere answers it wrong there.

    Pairs rather than a mapping, because half the callers have an order

    an MCP env key spelled `https://host/x?auth=...` is secret-shaped by

    Two keys can sanitize to one spelling (`https://a:1@host/x` and
    `https://b:2@host/x` are both `https://host/x`), and a mapping
    comprehension would answer with the last of them and drop the rest.
