Alembic's autogenerate needs three things this project deliberately
does not have lying around: an `alembic.ini` naming a script location, a
database URL, and a connection to compare the metadata against. Each
`env.py` refuses to run without a connection and a chain handed in on
the config's attributes, which is what keeps the `VINGA_DB_*` variables
the one place the connection is decided, and that refusal is also what
makes the command unrunnable from a shell. So the command is spelled
here instead: a scratch database on the configured instance, brought to
head through the packaged chain, compared against that chain's metadata,
and dropped. Nothing an operator runs, and nothing the server imports.

Every chain, because there are three of them and only one used to have
an entry point here. Which one is an argument rather than three
commands: the work is identical and the chain is the only thing that
differs, which is what `StoreChain` is.

Creating a database needs `CREATEDB`, which the runtime connection
contract deliberately does not ask for: this runs on a development or
test maintenance connection (the compose superuser, or any role that may
create databases), and a deployment's server role is never asked for it.

What comes out is a candidate and is treated as one. Autogenerate sees
tables, columns, types and constraints; it does not see why a column is
nullable, or that a boolean needs a server-side default so a row written
before it says false itself. Read the file, write its docstring, and fix
what it got wrong before committing it.

`main` is a command boundary and not a thin wrapper around `generate`.
This is the one module in the project that connects with psycopg
directly and issues `CREATE DATABASE` and `DROP DATABASE`, and psycopg
quotes the DSN it tried in every failure it raises, password and query
parameters included. Letting one of those escape a module entry point
would print a connection string to stderr, which is the highest-priority
thing this project's refusals exist to prevent. So the whole maintenance
lifecycle sits behind one sanitized answer: a fixed sentence, no
exception, exit 1.

# It used to be one fixed name, dropped `with (force)` before the run and

# also meant two runs against one instance dropped each other's database
# mid-use, since `force` terminates the connections first, and two unit
# lanes from two worktrees sharing the development instance is ordinary.
# A name of a run's own makes the force safe: it only ever reaches a
# database that run created.
#
# The price is that a run killed before its `finally` (SIGKILL, a lost
# connection) leaves its database behind, and nothing removes it
# automatically. A sweep by prefix was considered and rejected: from the
# catalog alone a dead run's database and a live one are the same thing,
# and dropping a live one is the bug this name exists to fix. A leftover
# is found by the prefix and dropped by hand, from any database but
# itself:
#
#     select datname from pg_database where datname like 'vinga\_autogen\_scratch\_%';
