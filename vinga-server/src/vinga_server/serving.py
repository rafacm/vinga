"""Serving: the uvicorn configuration, the startup, and the drain.

Everything a running server is, from the boot that reads both halves of
the configuration to the shutdown that lets conversations finish. The
command line in front of it is `main.py`, which reaches this module only
in its serve branch and only when the server half is installed.

The split is what makes that conditional reach possible. This module
imports FastAPI, uvicorn, the composition, the boot path, the onboarding
banner and the providers, and `DrainingServer` subclasses
`uvicorn.Server` at import time, so a module that holds any of it cannot
be imported by an installation that carries the client half alone. The
configuration grammar is on the other side of that line, and the
sentence a thin installation is answered with lives in `main.py`,
which is the one file both installations import.

A redeploy ends every conversation in flight, and the OTA endpoint
cannot be restarted independently of the websocket one, so a graceful
stop is the server's own job. Uvicorn cannot do this part: it
fail-closes every open websocket with 1012 the moment its shutdown
begins, so waiting for its graceful shutdown to drain conversations is
not possible. The drain therefore runs first, from the signal handler,
and uvicorn's shutdown is what happens after it.

# `mcp_servers` alone, deliberately, because in each of them the

# sentence saying the location addresses one row would be this
# milestone's own defect committed inside its fix.
#
# And the pointer is a pointer. `docs/reference/cli.md` writes the

# change; the sentence says which is which rather than claiming both.
