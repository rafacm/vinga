"""What a device is answered when it asks what its backend is.

The POST every board makes on every boot and the human GET beside it.
The reply carries the websocket URL and its token, the word for how that
token is to be read, the wall clock, the firmware verdict, and, for a
device nobody has claimed, the `activation` section that puts a
six-digit code on its screen.

The decision behind that section is not made here. `activation_for` in
`onboarding.unbound` answers what an unbound device gets and returns a
tagged result; `_activation` below is the wrapper that turns two of its
four outcomes into the two warnings this endpoint has always emitted, on
this endpoint's own channel. That is the whole of what this module knows
about the ceremony.

    chosen, in size and in shape, by a stranger, and two properties have
    to hold whatever they chose:

    - **Nothing allocated is the body's size.** Every step emits one
      token bounded by what is left of the budget, and the walk stops
      the step after the accumulation passes the bound. `iterencode`
      cannot do this and the first review round did not catch it: it
      yields a scalar string as ONE chunk, so a ten-megabyte field is
      ten megabytes built and appended before any bound can bite.
    - **It cannot run out of stack.** Depth costs a `_Frame` in a list,
      so a body nested past any recursion limit is a truncated value.
      `iterencode` recurses once per level, so a body the parser
      accepted could still break the encoder, which is a 500 on the one
      endpoint every board must reach.

    A string is escaped in a slice of at most the remaining budget plus
    one character. Escaping never shortens, so one character past the
    budget already proves the value overflows it, and taking more would
    be work the bound has made pointless.

    A value with more to say is cut at
    `CHECK_IN_BODY_LIMIT - len(CHECK_IN_BODY_TRUNCATED)` and ends with
    that marker, so it is visibly truncated, never longer than the
    bound, and carries nothing from past the cut. The cut is decided on

    answers with a tagged outcome and warns about nothing. The narration
    is here because these two warnings are this endpoint's: they are
    emitted on the `vinga_server.ota` channel, in this module's words,
    about a device that is being answered by this handler.

    say, and names them as literals rather than falling back on a
    wildcard: a fifth added upstream has to be visible here as an
    outcome nothing handles, and `case _` would handle it by definition.

    What fails on a drift is
    `test_unbound.py::test_the_reply_narrates_every_outcome_the_decision_can_answer`,

    literal's members, both ways. `match` falls through a subject no
