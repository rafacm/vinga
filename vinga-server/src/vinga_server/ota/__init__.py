"""The device OTA/config endpoint.

A device running stock xiaozhi firmware knows exactly one thing about its
backend: the OTA URL held in NVS. On every boot it POSTs its system info
there and takes the rest of its configuration from the reply, persisting it
to NVS: the websocket URL with its token and protocol version, the wall
clock, and whether a firmware update is waiting.

vinga-server serves no firmware images, so the firmware section always
answers "up to date" by echoing back the version the device reported.

A device the database has nothing to say about is answered with an
`activation` section instead of a token: a six-digit code it shows on
its screen and speaks, which an operator reads off the board and binds
with one command. The device polls `/activate` every three seconds
while it waits, so a bind takes effect with no power cycle and no
button press. A device that is bound is never asked to activate, and
one that is not always is, a default agent set or not (#612): an
unbound device only pairs.

This endpoint is the token issuer, so it cannot itself require a token.
What protects it instead is stinginess and a configurable path: a token
is issued only to a device the configuration resolves to an agent this
server is serving, and an operator exposing the server publicly hides
the endpoint behind a long random path segment.

Which agents a device is bound to is the one question here that is not
answered out of the world being served. `DeviceBindings` reads it from
the database at every check-in, so a board bound while the server runs
is handed its token at the next one it makes, seconds later, with
nothing asked of the server; whether the agent it names is one this
server can serve is asked of the world current as the check-in is
answered, which a reload can have moved since the last one.

A file each, under this one:

- `reply` is the check-in: what a board is told about itself, its
  clock, its firmware and where to talk, and the wrapper that narrates
  the activation decision `onboarding.unbound` makes.
- `poll` is the request a waiting board repeats until it is claimed.
- `router` mounts those three handlers, at the configured OTA path and
  again at the short onboarding alias, by reference and never by copy.

This `__init__` IS the module `vinga_server.ota`, and the two rules
that follow from that are the ones the onboarding package lives by.
EVENTS go through the emitter built here, which a submodule takes with
`from . import events` and reaches no other way, so the channel is this
package's name by construction and the `logger` field of every record is
what it always was: `vinga_server.ota`, which twelve pins assert
literally. And submodules import their siblings directly and take
nothing else from here, so only this file aggregates.

Upstream reference: `main/ota.cc` in 78/xiaozhi-esp32 parses this response.

# And the gathering, which happens after the emitter rather than above
# it: each submodule reads the emitter out of this module, so it has to
# be here before the first of them is read.
#
# The first name is not a submodule's. `websocket_url_for` is not
# defined in this package any more: it is one of the two modes of
# `onboarding.origin.assemble` (issue #143), and the module that answers
# "what address does the outside world use" answers this too. It is
# named here because it was importable from `vinga_server.ota` before
# the split and nothing about the reply body changed.
