"""Where a waiting device polls until somebody claims it.

The other half of the activation ceremony: the reply puts a code on the
screen, and this is the request the firmware repeats every three seconds
until the answer changes from "keep waiting" to "you are configured".
Nothing is minted here and nothing is bound here; the binding happens on
the operator's side, and this only reports what the bindings already
say.

    apart, until it is claimed.

    200 means the MAC resolves to an agent this server is serving, so a
    200 always means the next OTA check hands the device its real
    configuration. 202 is everything else, which is what upstream's own
    "keep waiting" is: a device still unbound, a device bound to an
    agent this server is not serving (which flips to 200 at the reload
    that installs it), and a device this server has no pending entry for
    at all, since a restart loses the table and the device's own loop
    fetches a fresh code within a couple of minutes.

    What a version-2 body claims cannot be authenticated. Its HMAC is
    computed with a key burned into the device's eFuses, which the
    vendor's cloud knows from registration and vinga has no copy of, so
    the code ceremony governs both versions (the plan's fourth
    author-approved deviation from issue #40). What is checked while the
    MAC is pending is what can be: the body parses, names an algorithm
    this server knows, and echoes the challenge this server issued. A
    poll answering somebody else's challenge is not evidence of
    anything, so it is refused with the 202 it would have got anyway and
    a log line naming which check failed.
