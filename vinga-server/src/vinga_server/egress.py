"""The one rule behind the local-first promise (#30, #136).

A fully local deployment is first-class, and the product promise makes
that a guarantee enforced rather than documented
(`docs/architecture/product-promises.md`): everything that can
carry session data off the machine declares whether it does, and
`server.local_only` refuses at startup to build one that does. The
enforcement used to exist twice, once in the provider registry and once
in the MCP build path, each with its own semantics, wording and
exception type, and the provider half defaulted an undeclared type to
egress, so a type that forgot to declare merely looked declared enough
to boot. A guarantee spread over two implementations and a default is
one nobody can read in a sitting, so both live here (#136), and neither
caller decides anything: they translate. The third shape arrived with
the OTLP exporter (#66), which is neither a provider class nor an
operator-declared entry, and it landed here for the same reason rather
than as a rule of its own beside the thing it governs.

Translation is all they do because the exception type is each surface's
own contract. This module raises `EgressRefusal` carrying the finished
sentence; `build_provider` re-raises it as `ProviderError` and
`_managers_for` as `McpConfigError`, with the message untouched.
Importing either of those here is what a module below both callers
cannot do, and the reason this one sits beside the packages it serves
rather than inside one of them.

The sentences are operator-facing and value-free: they name the
configuration entry, the type and the key to write, never the value that
was read. The provider refusals say "off this host" and the MCP ones
"off this network", which is a distinction rather than drift: a provider
is a library running in this process, while an MCP entry's command or
URL reaches whatever the machine can.

    The third shape the guarantee comes in, and the reason it is here

    and diverged, which is what put both of the others in this module,
    and a telemetry exporter deciding for itself what `local_only` means
    would be the third copy starting the same way.

    The declaration is the argument, because that is the whole of what
    varies. A provider's marking is read off its class and an MCP
    entry's off the operator's configuration; a feature like the OTLP
    exporter has neither, because whether it reaches the network is a
    property of what it IS rather than of how it was configured. It
    declares `True` at the call site and this decides what follows.

    Called before the feature is built, which is the caller's half of
    the contract and the only way the sentence can honestly say nothing
    was constructed. The sentence names both keys and no value: which
