"""Which world new work binds to, and whether it is holding still.

A running server used to serve exactly what it booted on, and the one
sentence every module could rely on was that the configuration is a
boot-time snapshot. Applying a stored change without a restart does not
make that sentence false; it makes it narrower. The snapshot is still
immutable and still validated whole. What changes is that there can be
more than one of them over the life of a process, and that a piece of
work binds one of them at its own convergence point rather than
inheriting the only one there was (#191).

So this module owns two facts and nothing else. A `Generation` is one
such world: the configuration to serve, the stored credentials that open
behind it, and what was built from the two of them, frozen together
because a configuration and what was made from it are one state and
holding them apart is how two loads come to disagree. `Generations` is
where the current one is found and where the next one is put, and it is
the only place a swap happens.

The second half of that second fact is the end of a world rather than
its beginning, and it is here for the same reason: a swap is also a
retirement, and something has to know when a world nobody serves and
nobody holds may let go of the engines it was speaking through. That
rule lives here, and the counting it needs does not: who still holds a
world is the session registry's knowledge, so it is passed in and never
kept.

The mark beside it exists because reading two things across an await is
not the same as reading one world. An apply changes serving state more
than once (the generation, then the MCP install), so a counter advanced
only at the end would leave a window in which a reader sees a moved
world under an unmoved number. The holder reads unstable for the whole
of an apply instead, from before its first change until after its last,
and a reader that captures the mark either side of an await has to treat
"unstable" and "moved" the same way: neither says the world held still.

Deletion test: inlined into `app.py` the composition root would own the
swap and retirement rules, and inlined into the runtime the conversation
layer would own a server-wide lifecycle. Both are decisions with exactly
one home, and this is it.

    """One world this server serves: a validated configuration snapshot,
    the stored credentials loaded beside it, and the speech synthesized
    for it ahead of time.

    The first two travel together for the reason `config.boot.BootConfig`'s
    do: the credentials are needed exactly where the configuration is
    turned into running things, and a generation whose secrets came from
    a different load would build one world's providers with another
    world's keys. Nothing here holds plaintext.

    `fillers` is here for the same reason one step further on. A clip is
    a configured phrase spoken by a configured voice, so it is a
    consequence of this world and not of this process, and putting it
    anywhere else would be a second place that has to agree with the
    configuration above it. A session binds the mapping at its
    construction, which is what makes the convergence point the next
    session: a conversation's masking does not change under it
    mid-turn. Empty is a deployment where no agent masks its latency,
    which is the default.

    `fallbacks` is the other kind of clip the same module builds, here
    for exactly the reasons `fillers` is and bound at the same instant:
    what a failed reply says is a configured phrase in a configured
    voice, and a conversation says the phrase it opened with. Empty is a
    world built before anything synthesized, which is what a test that
    is not about failure phrases hands in; a served world holds one per
    agent that has not switched the section off.

    `providers` is here for the reason the clips are, one step further
    again: the engines a conversation speaks through are what this
    world's provider entries resolved to, and an entry an apply rewrote
    is a different object. A session binds the world at its
    construction, so a rebuilt engine reaches the next conversation and
    never the middle of one. The objects are shared with the worlds that
    still use them: an entry whose model and stored credentials did not
    move is carried over rather than built again, so two generations can
    hold the same provider and the last of them to be let go of is what
    closes it.

    `config` carries the file half as well as the domain half, and that
    is not an accident of composition: a reload never re-reads the file,
    so `config.server` is the section this process started with and is
    the same object in every generation. A caller that needs a
    restart-only setting may therefore read it here without asking which
    generation it got.

    Frozen, and the whole point: a generation is never edited. A change
    is a new one, built entirely before anything binds it, so a refusal
    has touched nothing that is running.

    Compared by identity rather than by value, which is what a world is:
    two generations built from the same configuration are two worlds,
    holding two sets of engines, and telling them apart is the whole of
    what the lifecycle below does.
