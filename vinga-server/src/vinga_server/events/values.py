"""The vocabulary a typed event is written in.

An event's payload is metadata and nothing else ([the content and
telemetry ADR](../../../../docs/adr/2026-08-15-content-and-telemetry-are-separate-surfaces.md)),
and it used to be a claim a registry made ABOUT a value: a field said
"this position holds a session id" and a validator read the value back
at emit time to see whether it did. This module makes it a claim the
value itself carries. A `SessionId` is a session id because it
could not have been constructed otherwise, and a site that has one has
already proved it.

Three properties are load-bearing, and none of them is incidental:

- **Construction is the check.** Every type here refuses at
  construction what a validator used to refuse at emit. The annotation
  alone proves nothing at runtime, so the check is explicit and runs
  whatever a type checker did or did not see.
- **A refusal never repeats what it refused.** The value handed to a
  value type is exactly the thing that may not reach a log, a lane's
  stderr or an exception chain, so `EventValueError` names the type and
  the constraint and stops there. This is the same rule the emitter's
  own refusal report keeps, applied one layer earlier.
- **What rides the record is a plain builtin.** `carried()` and
  `rendered()` answer `str`, `int` or the configured path object, never
  the wrapper, so a tap, a JSON formatter and a `%` rendering meet
  exactly what they met before the types existed.

The two halves are separate on purpose. `carried()` is what the payload
field holds and `rendered()` is what the sentence's `%` position
receives, and they differ where a path is concerned: the field carries
the path as text, the sentence renders the object, and that is the
shape the surface has today.

The kinds, the syntaxes, the descriptor bounds and the composed grammars
live here too. They were the untyped registry's while it survived and
was the one home of them; they came here with the last conversion, since
a kind is what a value IS here rather than a claim a declaration makes
about it.

# restated; here it is a member of an enumeration, so a site that names
# one has named a value that exists. The enumerations are restated from
# their decision sites rather than imported from them, because those
# sites live in `device/`, `runtime/`, `onboarding/` and `tools/`, all of
# which import THIS and would close a cycle. The unit tests hold the
# restatements equal to their sites, which is where the retired
# conformance walk's token check went. The descriptor bounds are the one
# exception and ARE imported, because `config/models.py` reaches nothing
# in this package.
#
# These are the one refusal on this surface that does repeat what it
# refused: a lookup of a string outside the set raises the enumeration's
# own `ValueError`, which names the value, and the module's second
# load-bearing property above does not hold for it. That is why every
# site that looks a string up spells the lookup inside the thunk it
# hands the emitter, where `_construct` catches it and answers
# `construction_failed` with the value nowhere in it.
#
# Three variants admit fewer members than their enumeration does, and
# each declares the narrowing as a `Literal` alias beside the set it
# narrows. A `Literal` names the parent's members rather than restating
# their values, so there is nothing for the two to drift apart on. They
# are spelled as plain assignments rather than PEP 695 `type`
# statements, because the catalog reads annotations with
# `get_type_hints`, which resolves a plain alias to the `Literal` itself
# and would hand a `type` statement's alias back wrapped.
