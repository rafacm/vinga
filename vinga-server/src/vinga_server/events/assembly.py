"""How an event about a provider or a tool call is put together.

The reply path used to hold this. A third of `runtime/pipeline.py`'s
executable code chose between event shapes, ordered field lists, and
knew which value type wrapped which argument, which is telemetry shape
logic living in the middle of the code that answers a person. What a
caller passes now is the thing that happened, in plain values, and what
it gets back is the variant that describes it: it names no variant
class, orders no field list, and learns nothing about which value type
wraps which argument.

The depth is not a vocabulary crossing, because there is none: the
signatures below take builtins and answer a `Variant`. It is two facts
that would otherwise be the caller's. The entry quartet is one type
whose `provider` and `type` are required, so the four values a
configured provider contributes are built in exactly one place and are
answered whole or not at all. And the fragment naming a tool is a
function here, so the one sentence about a call that is not an event
states the rule about which names this application may print beside the
declarations that hold the three that are to the same rule.

Plain values in, one variant out, and nothing injectable. The module
imports the catalog and the value vocabulary and no subsystem, which is
what lets it be called from anywhere an event is emitted.
