"""What the server says about itself, in one place, to whoever is listening.

The structured JSON records are the observability surface
([ADR](../../../../docs/adr/2026-08-04-json-logs-are-the-observability-surface.md)),
which makes them output rather than a debugging aid: their channel, their
sentences, their levels and their field names are a compatibility surface.
They are metadata and nothing else: the record of what was said is the
conversation store (#120, and the [content and telemetry
ADR](../../../../docs/adr/2026-08-15-content-and-telemetry-are-separate-surfaces.md)),
and these events are the operator's live view of the same conversation,
correlated with it by session id.
Yet the machinery serving them used to belong to one subsystem, sitting in
`device/events.py` and used by the device edge and the pipeline while every
other module hand-built an `extra={...}` dict of its own (#138).

So the emitter moved here, to an altitude neither the device edge nor a
runtime owns: `device/`, `runtime/` and every server subsystem import
downward into this module, and it imports none of them. It also stopped
being a payload factory that call sites logged around and became the thing
that emits: a site says
`events.emit(lambda: Heard(agent=..., duration_s=Real(seconds)))`
and the emitter builds the payload, wraps it, and hands it to every
attached consumer.

A consumer is a **tap**. The JSON log is the first one and always attached;
the capture's decision track is the second; #120's conversation store and
the #66/#67 exporters attach as more, without touching a single emit site.
That is what the interface exists for.

Three invariants shape the dispatch, and none of them is incidental:

- **An event that is logged is an event that is recorded.** The capture
  used to be written inside the payload builder, before the logging call
  returned, so the record was offered to it first by construction. The
  taps therefore dispatch non-log taps in attachment order FIRST and the
  log LAST, which preserves that ordering exactly.
- **A broken consumer breaks nothing else.** Each tap runs under its own
  guard, so a tap that raises does not starve the taps after it, the log
  above all. The failure is reported once as a plain sentence on the
  emitter's own channel: not an event, because an event would go back
  through the taps and a broken tap would recurse into itself.
- **No consumer can rewrite what is kept.** Every non-log tap is handed
  its own deep copy of the payload, so a tap that edits a nested value,
  or adds a key `logging` reserves, changes only its own copy. The
  retained log is not reachable from code this module does not own.

The tap contract is events only. `SessionEvents.vad()` and `.dropped()`
are per-frame entry points and stay outside it: both are sampled at the
mic's own rate, and a record per frame would swamp every surface that
reads one. `vad()` feeds the capture's own track and stops there, since
no other consumer has a meaning for it. `dropped()` does not stop there
any more: the per-second total it accumulates leaves as a
`frames_dropped` emission through the ordinary seam, so the capture's
decision track and every other tap read one declaration instead of each
doing the arithmetic.

Two scopes, and the difference between them is a clock. A session event
carries the session's identity and is stamped with the session loop's
clock, because the capture's audio tracks are aligned by it. A server
event names what it is about explicitly (`device=`, `entry=`, `host=`) and
is stamped with `time.monotonic`, because server events fire where no loop
is running: `create_app` reports its capture directory before the server
serves anything.

And a site cannot say a thing `catalog.py` does not declare. It hands
`emit()` a thunk that builds a typed variant instead of restating a
template, an argument order, an event name and a field set: the
declaration owns all four, and every value is a type that refuses at
construction what it does not admit, so there is nothing left for a call
to get wrong (#155, #210). What there used to be was a validator that
read the finished payload back and judged it against a registry, and it
went with the duplication it existed to reconcile.

What survives at runtime is the guard, because construction can still
fail on a value. A refusal costs one plain sentence on the emitter's own
channel and the emission is dropped, so a telemetry bug can never cost a
reply. The thunk is what makes that possible: building, validating,
rendering and serializing all happen inside the guard, where
`emit(SomeVariant(...))` would have evaluated the constructor on
whatever path was emitting.
