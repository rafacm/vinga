"""What this server may say, declared once per event as typed variants.

The registry this replaced described an emission; a catalog entry IS
one. That is the whole difference, and everything else follows from it.
A site used to restate the template, the argument order, the event name
and the field set at every call, and five structures had to agree for
one record to be lawful: the declaration, the call, the pin, the sidecar
entry and the conformance walk's reading of the source. Here the call
constructs the declaration, so there is nothing left for it to disagree
with.

**One declaration per event code, holding a discriminated set of typed
variants.** An event is not one shape: `conversations_failed` says two
different sentences about two different failures under one name, and
the surface has events with variants across channels and levels. So a
declaration names the event and owns its variants, and a caller
constructs the specific variant named after the thing that happened.
Documentation and the golden inventory derive from the enclosing
declaration.

**A variant owns its whole emission.** Its channel, its level, its
exact payload shape (names, types, requiredness, nullability), and its
rendering. `Emission` and `LogTap` are untouched: every variant derives
its logging specification, the unrendered template and the ordered
argument tuple those two already carry, from its own fields. The record
a tap or a log reader sees is therefore the record it saw before, which
is what the committed baseline proves rather than claims.

**Absence and null are different answers.** A field that is present and
null is a fact the record states; a field that is absent is a key the
JSON object does not have. A bare `| None` cannot say which a site
meant, so a variant annotates an omittable field with `Absent` and the
payload builder drops it, while a nullable one keeps its key.

**Documentation facts are declaration metadata.** Notes, the constraint
a value type carries, the syntaxes and the bounds are declared here and
on the value types, never introspected from prose, and there is no
second description of a declaration for a generator to read: the
reference reads the declarations themselves. A closed set is the one
constraint the annotation itself may state: a field annotated with its
enumeration admits every member, one annotated with a `Literal` over
some of them admits those, and `Declared` carries the answer either
way, so nothing downstream reads it off a type.

The module imports the value vocabulary and the standard library, and
imports no subsystem: the arrows keep pointing downward.
