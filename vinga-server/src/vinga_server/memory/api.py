"""What this deployment remembers, on the gated /api: three scopes,
addressed.

The operator's door onto memory, and the audit door before it is
anything else. An agent accrues facts about the person it talks to, a
board accrues notes about the place it stands in, and a conversation
keeps a ledger of what is currently true in it. All three are content
somebody said in a room, all three are injected into a prompt, and until
this namespace existed the only way to see any of it was to read the
tables. The `memory` schema is deliberately not granted to the read-only
analyst role, so this is the surface rather than SQL.

Three questions it answers, in the order an operator asks them: who is
remembering anything at all, what is one of them remembering, and this
is wrong, take it out.

The route functions live here and are registered by `config/api.py`'s
`_application()`, exactly as the conversation record's are, so a route
cannot be served without being in the committed contract; `problems`
travels with them because the import cannot go both ways.

Nothing here decides what a scope means. `memory/store.py` owns the
tables, the caps, the held area and the index, and every statement below
is one of its own sentences on a connection this module opened.

Four transport rules the routes hold to, three of them the conversation
namespace's and one this namespace's own:

- **An owner with no rows is an empty shape, never a 404.** The #283
  contract: what a deployment that has been told nothing has is empty
  tables, and an empty listing is the honest answer about them. The
  refusals that remain are the two about something addressed: a fact
  number, and a ledger entry named in a body.
- **Nothing a caller sends is quoted back**, refusals included, and the
  values these routes are handed are exactly the ones a mistake puts a
  credential into.
- **A cursor is plain values a caller can read.** The fact listings walk
  the row ids and the three owner listings walk the owner text; both are
  what the previous page answered with, and neither is an encoding a
  later release has to keep reading.
- **Content never rides a URL.** A corrected fact and a ledger key
  travel in a request body and never in a path segment or a query
  argument. A fact is what somebody said and a key is what a model
  chose, so either can be credential-shaped, and a path reaches proxy
  and access logs where a body does not.

Every read opens a connection for the length of one request through
`db.read_engine`, and every write opens a transaction for the length of
one through `db.write_engine` on the memory chain, which takes that
chain's advisory lock at BEGIN. Neither holds an engine between
requests, and neither migrates anything: boot owns the schema.

One of these writes reaches rows a conversation's own lifecycle owns,
the ledger, so it is taken inside the erasure order the conversation
record publishes through, exactly as an erasure is. What that buys is
that this deletion and the transaction that may be erasing the same
thread are ordered rather than interleaved, so the count this answers
with is a count of rows this request took. It consults no dead-thread
set, and the reason is that the set exists to stop a write from
recreating a row for a thread that is gone: every statement this door
issues against a thread is a delete.
