"""The tables holding what an agent was asked to remember, and what is
currently true in one conversation.

Its own `MetaData` and its own schema (`memory`), beside the domain
configuration and the conversation record rather than inside either,
and the deciding rule is the one `db/schema.py` and
`conversations/schema.py` both state: which schema a store lives in is
a fact of that store. Neither existing schema fits. `domain` holds the
configuration an operator writes, and its advisory lock serializes
writers whole, so a `remember` riding that chain would wait behind an
`apply` transaction that is deliberately unbounded. `record` holds what
was said, is shaped by a session and thread retention that memory does
not have, and is granted to the read-only analyst role, which this
schema deliberately is not.

Two tables and not one, because they answer different questions with
different shapes. A fact list is ordered, id-addressed and carries a
held area an undo reaches into; a ledger is keyed, current-only, and has
neither. One remembered fact is one row of `facts`; one thing that is
currently true in one conversation is one row of `state`.

No generated reference is rendered from these comments, unlike the
conversation record's. The record's page exists because operators query
that schema as `vinga_ro`; nobody but the server may read this one, so
the page would document a surface with no external reader. The comments
are here for whoever reads the tables through `psql`, and for the
migrations that reproduce them.
