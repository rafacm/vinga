"""The store behind what an agent remembers: one chain, two engines.

What this module hides from its callers is the whole of the storage: a
schema of its own and the migrations that build it, an advisory lock
that serializes writers across processes, a write engine that takes
that lock before it reads anything, a separate read-only engine so a
reply's memory read never waits on a writer, and a connection whose
failures are classified rather than quoted. A caller asks for a store
and disposes it; it never learns which schema, which lock key, which
isolation level, or what a psycopg failure looks like. It never learns
what a scope is stored as either: it names one, and the store knows
which table, which cap and which index that means.

Three memories, addressed as a scope and an owner. An agent's own,
keyed by its configured name, because an agent is one entity across
rooms: "remember I am vegetarian", said in the kitchen, holds in the
bedroom. A device's, keyed by its MAC and shared by every agent bound
to it, which is where the place and the household belong. And a
conversation's, keyed by the thread's uuid hex, a ledger of what is
currently true that shares its thread's lifecycle whole. Telling people
apart on a shared device is still the voiceprint problem, and none of
these three solves it.

What a caller gets, in the order the sentences are met:

- `read_for_prompt(agent, device, conversation)`, every scope a prompt
  is assembled from, rendered in one round trip. The agent's block is
  the newest of its facts rather than the whole of them, and a caller
  with no device or no thread behind it says so and gets the scopes it
  asked for.
- `add`, `update`, `forget` and `restore`, addressed by the id `add`
  answers with and bounded by the ownership of the row rather than by
  the model's good behavior. One door onto keeping a fact, whichever
  scope it belongs to, so the rules a fact is held to cannot differ by
  which sentence a caller happened to speak. `restore` is addressed by
  every memory the caller may reach rather than by one of them, because
  with no id it is a choice among rows and which memory holds the newest
  of them is its answer to give.
- `recall(agent, device, query)`, a bounded lookup over every active
  fact those two scopes hold, which is how the model reaches what the
  prompt did not inject and how it learns the number of a fact it wants
  to correct.
- `set_state` and `clear_state`, the conversation's ledger.
- `purge_threads` and `sweep`, which take the memory of threads that
  are gone, and `purge`, the same deletes on a transaction somebody
  else owns, which is how a thread's erasure takes its memory in the
  commit that takes its turns.

A conversation's memory shares its thread's lifecycle, so this store
keeps the other end of the conversation record's erasure-order protocol:
every thread-keyed write is ordered against the deletion that may be
taking that thread, and `threads_erased` is what a deletion tells it.
What a caller sees is one more fixed refusal.

Injection is still the standard shape for what fits: it costs no lookup
latency (a lookup round trip is spoken silence) and does not depend on
a small local model choosing to call it. The caps are what keep that
true, and the two-tier shape the file store's docstring predicted is
what the agent scope became once it outgrew the prompt: a small
injected core, and the rest reachable by asking.

The chain is declared here rather than beside `db.open_at`, for the
reason the conversation store's is: which schema a store lives in is a
fact of that store, and the schema name is read off the metadata that
declares it.

    The seam the cross-store deletion is made of: this module owns the
    SQL and the caller owns the transaction, so a thread's erasure and
    its memory leave in the same commit and there is never a moment when
    the thread is gone while its state remains. A failure therefore has
    to reach the caller and take its transaction down with it, because a
    purge that swallowed one would let an erasure answer with counts a
    rollback made false.

    What reaches the caller is a refusal of this module's own, never the
    driver's. A SQLAlchemy failure carries the statement it ran and the
    parameters bound into it, and the parameters here are thread ids: a
    caller that rendered one into a problem body or a log line would be
    quoting the very identifiers an erasure exists to remove. So the
    refusal is built inside the handler and raised after it, cause
    severed, and the caller's transaction rolls back exactly as it would
    have.

    A function rather than a method, because neither caller has a store.
    The conversation record's writer is handed this at construction
    (importing it there would be a cycle, since this module reads the
    record's own table), and a deletion through the operator API runs on
    a connection it opened for itself, precisely so that erasure works
    in a deployment with recording off. What the SQL needs is a
    connection, and a store would be a parameter neither of them has to
    give.

    The memory chain's advisory lock is taken before the first statement
    rather than left to the caller's engine, which is what makes the
    ascending order `db.advisory_key` states a property of this
    function: a caller on the record chain's write engine is already
    holding key 2 when it arrives here, and this takes key 3 second. A
    caller already on the memory chain's own engine is taking a lock it
    holds, which costs nothing. It is taken inside the boundary below
    like every other statement here, because a lock that does not arrive
    inside the timeout is exactly the contended case the retryable
    sentence is for.

) -> int:
    """Move everything one owner holds in one scope onto another owner,
    on a connection the caller already holds, and answer how many rows
    moved.

    The memory third of a rename, and `purge`'s seam widened by one
    verb: this module owns the SQL and the caller owns the transaction,
    so an agent's row, its bindings and its facts move in one commit and
    there is never a moment when the agent has been renamed and its
    memory has not. A failure therefore reaches the caller and takes its
    transaction down with it. The signature is `erase_facts`'s with a
    destination added, because what it addresses is the same pair.

    Two acts reach it, which is the whole reason the scope is a
    parameter rather than a constant: an agent rename moves facts from
    one agent name to another, and a board swap moves what a room told a
    device onto the MAC of the board that stands there now (#449, M4).
    Nothing below is agent-specific, and the one thing that was, the
    sentence an occupied destination is refused with, is now chosen by
    the scope.

    The chain's advisory lock is taken before the first statement, for
    `purge`'s reason: it is what makes the ascending order
    `db.advisory_key` states a property of this function rather than of
    a call site somebody has to remember. A rename's caller arrives
    already holding key 1 and key 2, and this takes key 3 last.

    Check then update, and both under that one lock, because neither
    half can be expressed any other way. Nothing in this schema stops
    two owners becoming one, so a constraint cannot refuse the merge;
    and a count cannot report the difference between a destination that
    already has rows and a source that has none, since both are
    ordinary. The check cannot go stale between the two statements
    because the lock being held is the one every writer of this chain
    takes at BEGIN, so a competing `add` under the destination name
    queues behind this transaction rather than landing inside it.

    Held rows move with the active ones. A fact a conversation forgot
    carries `owner` like any other, so a restore after the rename still
    finds it, which is what makes the rename reversible in this store as
    well as in the others.

    The conflict travels untranslated. It is a state the caller can
    correct rather than a failure of the database, so it is raised past
    the classifying arm below rather than folded into a storage refusal,
    and it is a `ConfigError` subclass, which is what carries it through
    the callers' own handlers.

    Every refusal is built inside the handler and raised outside it, the
    rule this module keeps everywhere: a SQLAlchemy failure carries the
    statement it ran and the parameters bound into it, and the
    parameters here are two owners.

# requests. What the SQL needs is a connection, and a store would be a
# parameter no route has to give.
#

# a different door rather than a second copy of the tools':
#
# - **Every deletion here is a hard delete.** The held area is the

#   an operator removing a fact is removing it, and a row held for an
#   undo nobody is in a position to speak would be the correction not
#   taken.
# - **A correction is held to the same cap invariant a tool's is.** It
#   is refused where its own line alone will not fit, and the scope is
#   re-pruned inside the same transaction, so no door can leave a scope
#   over its bound.
