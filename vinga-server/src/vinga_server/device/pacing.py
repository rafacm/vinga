"""One reply's outgoing audio: the encoder, the cadence, and the
per-reply latches that hang off them.

A reply is not a buffer the device drains at its own speed. The board
plays what arrives as it arrives, so a long answer sent as fast as it
encodes floods its playback queue; what goes out has to leave at the
rate it will be heard at. That clock, the pause a barge-in confirmation
holds it with, and the once-per-reply facts measured against it (when
the first frame went out, whether the device has been told anything is
coming) are one cluster of arithmetic, and this is where it lives.

The session keeps the vocabulary either side of it. PCM comes in and
packets come out as plain bytes: `PlayableAudio` is a term of the
device boundary, and the events a first frame occasions are the
session's to emit, so nothing here has ever heard of an agent or an
event. What the session hands over instead is one closure per packet,
`deliver`, and this module decides when to call it.
