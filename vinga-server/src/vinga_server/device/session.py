"""One device connection: the xiaozhi edge, and nothing behind it.

The session owns the handshake, the wire, and the appliance. It accepts
the socket, checks the device's identity and its agent binding, exchanges
hellos, decodes mic Opus, encodes and paces reply Opus, frames both,
carries the device's own MCP tool transport, records the capture,
enforces the session limits and the idle timeout, and closes politely.

Three of those it owns without carrying: reply audio's encoder, cadence
and per-reply latches are [`pacing`](pacing.py), the recording's own
decode path is [`capture_audio`](capture_audio.py), and both of the
deadlines a connection is held to are [`watchdog`](watchdog.py). What
stays here is what those three would each need a copy of otherwise:
the protocol version, the manifest, the events object, and the policy
that decides what a deadline means.

What is said in the conversation it does not own. Behind it sits one
conversation runtime, built for this connection by the factory the
composition root handed in, reached only through the two protocols in
[`boundary`](boundary.py): this class is the `DeviceOutput` the runtime
speaks through, and the runtime is the `SessionInput` this class feeds.
The runtime is built after the device's agents resolve and before the
hello, which is where the first agent used to be activated by hand; a
connection turned away before that point never has one.

Two end-of-utterance triggers coexist because the firmware's listening
modes differ: manual mode sends `listen stop`, while auto and realtime
modes stream mic audio until the runtime decides the user finished. The
modes also differ in who re-arms the listening, and that is the one
turn-taking fact this side keeps: `user_turn_ended` stops the listening
in auto mode, where the device sends a fresh `listen start` after each
reply, and leaves it alone in realtime, where the device asked once and
is still streaming. A realtime session therefore hears the user through
its own speech, which is what makes barge-in possible; what an
interruption then does to the reply is the runtime's decision.
`server.barge_in` turns all of it off for a board whose echo
cancellation leaks its own voice back: those frames are dropped here,
before the decode, so the capture still records the evidence.

What happens in a conversation is logged twice over: as a human
sentence, and as structured fields (`event`, `session`, `device`, and
whatever the event carries) that the JSON log format emits as top-level
keys. Both are metadata: what was said is recorded in the conversation
store instead, under the same session id (#120). Both sides emit
through the session's `SessionEvents` ([events](../events/__init__.py)), so which
module a line came from is not visible in the record, and every consumer
attached to the session sees the same events.

        A capture outlives the code that made it, so it has to carry
        enough to be interpreted later. The barge-in thresholds matter
        most: an old capture analysed after they change is misleading
        unless it states its own. Which is also why a threshold that
        stops existing stops being written rather than being written
        null: a capture made before #80 states the `refractory_ms` its
        session was held against and one made after states no such key,
        and the `server.revision` beside them says which gates each ran.

        The timeout exists to close a realtime session that has stopped
        conversing. Nothing on the device side ends one: the firmware
        has no idle timeout, and its only closers are a button press,
        losing the network, and powering off. So a user who simply walks
        away leaves the mic streaming to the server, holding one of
        `max_sessions`, keeping the board out of the sleep mode that
        `CanEnterSleepMode` refuses while an audio channel is open, and
        running Opus decode and VAD over the silence, until the hour of
        `max_session_s` is up. This is the bound that makes that a
        couple of minutes instead (#20).

        Realtime only, which is the first half of this answer. An
        auto-mode device stops listening after each reply and re-arms
        per turn, so it is not streaming a room to anybody; realtime is
        the mode that asks once and then never stops. The mode is not
        known until the device sends its `listen start`, and it can in
        principle change, which is why the watchdog asks each time round
        rather than deciding once.

        A reply in flight is the second half. Not because it would
        otherwise be cut off (`request_shutdown` waits politely for one
        to finish speaking) but because of what follows: a timer that
        came due mid-reply has already decided to hang up, so the socket
        would close the instant the reply ended and the user would get
        no window at all to answer what they just heard.

        Arriving audio is deliberately not activity, which is why it
        appears in neither half and marks nothing. A realtime session
        streams continuously, silence included, so counting frames would
        mean the timer never fires, which is the bug. What counts is
        conversation: an utterance ending, or a reply ending.
