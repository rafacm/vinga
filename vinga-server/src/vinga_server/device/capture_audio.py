"""The audio half of a session capture: the recording's own decode path.

A capture records what happened, which is not the same material the
conversation ran on. The microphone track has to hold every frame that
arrived, including the ones the session's guards dropped, because those
are precisely the frames that explain a misfire; and the reply track
has to hold what the speaker played, which is the Opus that actually
went to the device rather than the PCM that was synthesized. Neither
can be taken off the pipeline's codecs: pushing guarded frames through
the pipeline's decoder would change what the conversation hears, and
the reply never passes through a decoder at all on its way out.

So recording needs three codec objects of its own, and this is the
module that owns them. Built only when a capture opens, so a server
that is not recording pays for none of it, and closed with the capture
it was built around.

The rule every path here follows: a frame the capture cannot read is
not a reason to stop capturing. Nothing raises out of this module.
