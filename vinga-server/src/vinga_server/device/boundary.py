"""The device-facing boundary: what the edge and a conversation runtime
may ask of each other, and nothing else.

Two protocols, in opposite directions. `SessionInput` is one
conversation runtime as the device edge sees it: audio in, the
protocol's turn-taking acts, and a lifecycle. `DeviceOutput` is the
device as a runtime sees it: show text, speak, pace, pause, and call the
device's own tools. Both are described in device terms, deliberately.
The test for whether something belongs here is the one the
device-facing-interface subrule states in the
[guidelines](../../../../docs/architecture/guidelines.md#the-internal-interface-is-device-facing):
would it still exist if the backend were a telephone call to a human?

What that rules out is the trap this boundary exists to avoid. There is
no universal conversation interface: nothing here says `commit_audio`,
`set_turn_detection` or `truncate_response`, because a boundary that
grows those is a home-grown, slightly wrong copy of every runtime's own
session protocol
([ADR](../../../../docs/adr/2026-08-10-normalize-the-hardware-edge.md)).

The boundary is inline awaited calls, not a frame queue. Every method is
called from where that code runs today, so ordering and backpressure are
what they were: audio is awaited from the serve loop, and incoming
frames buffer in the socket meanwhile. This is a seam, not a pipeline.

All PCM crossing it is s16le mono.

    """The device disconnected while the runtime was speaking to it.

    Raised by the edge in place of the transport's own disconnect, so a
    runtime never imports starlette to catch one. The edge translates
    both of the shapes a starlette socket produces, the disconnect it
    saw and the bare `RuntimeError` it raises for a send that came after
    the close, so a runtime catching this type alone catches every
    vanished device (#137). The reply body does exactly that.

    It still subclasses `RuntimeError`, which is what the one site that
    stayed broad relies on: the reply's closing `tts stop` pair
    suppresses `RuntimeError` around a device send, and this falls
    inside what it already swallows. The consequence is accepted and
    stated in the ADR: a broad `RuntimeError` catch also swallows a
    vanished device, which at that site is what is wanted. Filler
    playback used to be the second such site and no longer is: it
    catches this type alone, so a bare `RuntimeError` there is the
    local bug it always was and is reported as one (#182).

# How one conversation runtime is built for one connection: the device
# to speak through, the session's observability, the agent names the
# device is bound to, the world to build it from, and the device record
# the conversation attaches to.
#
# The record is the fifth argument for the reason the world is the
# fourth: it is resolved once, at the connect, in the same snapshot the
# binding came from, and everything the conversation later reads about
# its device is addressed by the identity in it. A runtime that looked
# the record up per round by the MAC it is talking to would be asking
# "which record stands at this address now", and an operator who
# deleted and re-bound a board would have moved a conversation to
# another device's name and place. None is a board with no record to
# attach to, and a conversation that says nothing about its device.
#
# The world is the fourth argument rather than something the factory
# looks up, and that is the whole of the generational binding (#191): a
# conversation is built from one generation, speaks through that
# generation's engines for the rest of its life, and is reported to the
# registry as holding it. A factory that read the current world for
# itself would leave the edge unable to say which one it got, and "which
# world is this conversation holding" is exactly what decides when the
# engines of a replaced one may be released.
#
# Deliberately not a config-selectable registry: one runtime exists, and
# a selection mechanism with one option is surface without a reader.
# This is the seam a second runtime plugs into, and what selection needs
# to express is decided when there is a second one.
