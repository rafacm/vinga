"""The `vinga-server events` command group: reference.

One command, and it reaches nothing. No database, no configuration file,
no key, and no server: the catalog is a Python module, and printing it
is reading that module. That is why the entrypoint dispatches this group
before it parses a server's arguments, the way it dispatches `config`
and `conversations`: a document that says what the events are must not
need a server that starts.

Usage errors leave as a sentence of this module's own, for the reason
the conversations group gives: several of argparse's quote what was
typed back at the user, and a value on stderr is a value in whatever
collects stderr. A reader who stops reading leaves the same way: this
document is long enough to outrun a pipe buffer, so `| head` is an
ordinary thing to do with it and has to be an ordinary thing to answer.
