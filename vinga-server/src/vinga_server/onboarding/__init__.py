"""Getting a stock board onto this server, and what it is answered
until an operator claims it.

Two halves, and they were one file until issue #143. One is the short
onboarding path, `/x/<key>/`, an alias of the OTA endpoint that a
person can type into a captive portal without a mistake, and the 404 a
wrong key meets. The other is the activation ceremony that same URL
leads to: the table of devices waiting to be claimed, the six-digit
code each of them is showing, and the `activation` section of the OTA
reply that puts the code on a screen.

A file each, under this one:

- `keys` derives the key, says what path it is served on, guards the
  handlers behind it and reports a miss without quoting either key. The
  router that mounts those guarded handlers lives beside the handlers,
  in `ota.router`, because the guard is a dependency of it and not the
  other way round.
- `origin` answers what address the outside world reaches this server
  on, in one assembler with a retained mode and a wire mode, and logs
  the startup banner that says it.
- `pending` is the table of waiting devices, its bounds and its claim
  lifecycle. It imports nothing device-facing, which is what lets the
  configuration API and `vinga-server config` read it.
- `unbound` is the one home of the question "what does a device with no
  agent get", plus the reply section that answers it.
- `browser` mints a browser's identity, and `try_links` holds the
  try links that bind one, issues them and redeems them (#613).

The key derivation and the origin resolution take the file half of the
configuration (`server`) rather than the composed whole, because they
read nothing else and because `vinga-server config ota-url` has
nothing else: it prints the URL to type before any server runs, from
the same file and the same environment, by calling these functions. A
second implementation of the derivation is the one thing that could
send an operator to a URL this server does not serve.

This `__init__` IS the module `vinga_server.onboarding`, and three
rules follow from that. EVENTS go through the emitter built here, which
a submodule takes with `from . import events` and reaches no other way,
so the channel is this package's name by construction and the `logger`
field of every record is what it always was. The TUNABLE BOUNDS are
defined here, above the submodule imports, and read through this module
at the moment a decision needs one: the suites monkeypatch them on the
name they have always lived on, and a name imported into a submodule
would be a snapshot no assignment reaches. And submodules import their
siblings directly and take nothing else from here, so only this file
aggregates.

# The activation ceremony's parameters. Constants rather than
# configuration: nobody has field evidence to tune them by, and a knob
# nobody can reason about is schema noise. If the field says otherwise
# they graduate to configuration then.
#
# They are also the bounds the suites move to test what happens at one,
# which is why they are defined HERE, before the submodule imports
# below, and read through this module rather than copied into the
# modules that decide by them.

# by digit off a compiled clip per digit and shows it on a small screen.

# How long one code stands. The device re-checks OTA every half minute

# is always what is current.
CODE_TTL_S = 600.0

# How many devices may be waiting at once. At the cap a new one gets
# exactly today's behavior, an empty token and no activation object,
# and a warning names the cap.
PENDING_CAPACITY = 128

# How many codes may be minted in any window of MINT_WINDOW_S, counting
# first issues and re-issues but not re-displays of a live code. The cap
# above bounds the standing table; this bounds the rate, so an outsider
# who fills the table and waits for it to expire is bounded per window
# rather than only per snapshot.
MINT_BUDGET = 30

MINT_WINDOW_S = 600.0

# How long a code has left after a claim of it failed, at least. A
# minute, because that is what makes the refusal's own advice ("run the

# attempt stepped over. It only ever extends, so a code that had longer
# keeps what it had.
RELEASED_GRACE_S = 60.0

# The try link's parameters (#613, D6, D6a), constants for the reason
# the four above are: the issue says minutes, and a key nobody needs is
# one more thing to document and refuse.
#
# How long a link stands once issued. Ten minutes: long enough to send
# it to the laptop on the other side of the room, short enough that a
# link left in a chat history is spent bearer material soon after.
TRY_LINK_TTL_S = 600.0

# How many unredeemed links the store holds at once. Each `vinga info`
# issues one, so this is a handful of operators running it a few times
# each inside ten minutes, with room to spare; past it a new link is
# refused until one is opened or expires, which is what keeps neither
# memory nor live bearer material growing without bound.
