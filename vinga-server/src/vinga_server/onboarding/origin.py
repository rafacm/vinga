"""What address the outside world reaches this server on, and the
startup line that says it.

One question, asked in five places: the banner below, the line
`vinga-server config ota-url` and `vinga-server doctor` print, the
`message` an activating device shows on its screen, the websocket URL
the OTA reply hands every board, and the portal line printed beside it
on the human GET of the same endpoint. The first three call
`public_origin`, so a deployment names itself the same way wherever it
is named, and the provenance travels with the value because two of the
three sources it resolves are inferences. The fourth calls
`websocket_url_for` and the fifth `portal_url_line`.

What a deployment may configure is two rules rather than one, and they
are deliberately not the same rule. The four addresses a person or a
screen is shown resolve `public_url` first and the origin of
`websocket_url` behind it, which is `_configured` below: `public_url`
is the name a deployment goes by, and where it is unset the websocket
URL is the one key a proxied deployment has already had to get right.
`websocket_url_for` consults `server.websocket_url` and nothing else,
because what it answers is the URL a board is handed rather than an
origin to print: `public_url` names an origin, may carry a path prefix
and says nothing about the websocket route, so a wire URL built from it
would be a guess wearing a configured key's authority.

Where the applicable key is unset, the two that answer a request have a
fallback the other three cannot have. A request is a demonstration of
an address that reached this server and the listen address is a guess
(issue #340), so the banner and the two commands guess, because nothing
has asked them anything, and the two lines in a reply prefer what the
request arrived on.

`onboarding_url` is the assembly the two commands share, and it lives
here for the same reason the origin does: it is one composition of the
origin above and the key `keys.py` derives, and a second copy of it
would be a second answer to what a person is supposed to type.

Both of them assemble through `assemble` below and neither assembles on
its own, which is the point of gathering them here (issue #143): there
is one place that turns a scheme, an authority and a path into a URL,
and one place to read to know what a device is told.

The two modes are a real distinction and not a convenience. An address
this server RETAINS (a banner, a screen, a log line, a printed URL) is
rebuilt from a parsed hostname and port, which is what keeps a
`user:password@host` out of it. An address that goes back out on the
WIRE, to the board that just reached us, is the request's own netloc
verbatim: it is the address that demonstrably works, this server trusts
no forwarded header to improve on it, and a rebuild could only make it
different from what arrived.

Which mode a request-derived origin is in is decided by what is done
with it rather than by where it came from. `websocket_url_for` is on the
wire and takes the netloc verbatim; the portal line is a URL printed for
a person to type, so it is retained by that rule and is rebuilt from the
request's own parsed hostname and port. The two agree on every Host a
board or a browser really sends, and where they would differ (userinfo
in the header, a port that is not a number) it is the printed line that
must not carry it.
