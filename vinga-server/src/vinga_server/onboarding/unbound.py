"""What a device with no agent is answered, decided in one place.

The activation ceremony the short URL leads to: the table of devices
waiting to be claimed, the six-digit code each of them is showing, and
the `activation` section of the OTA reply that puts the code on a
screen. A code is not a token: it is a claim ticket a person reads off
a board they are holding, and binding still needs the API's own bearer
token, so codes may appear in logs where device tokens never may.

The question "what does an unbound device get" used to be answered
across three files that had to agree (issue #143). `activation_for`
below is its one home: the onboarding gate, the emptiness test, the
provenance check, the table's own bounds, and the reply section, in
that order, each outcome tagged rather than narrated. The narration is
the caller's, which is what keeps the two `activation_not_offered`
warnings on the channel they have always been emitted on: this package
never emits about a decision the OTA endpoint is answering. The caller
is `ota.reply._activation`, a wrapper whose whole body is that
narration.
