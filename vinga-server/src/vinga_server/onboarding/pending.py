"""The pending-device table.

An unbound device is answered with a six-digit code, which it shows on
its screen and speaks digit by digit; the operator reads it off the
board in front of them and claims it with one command. The code is a
live claim ticket and nothing more, so this table is deliberately not
persistent: losing it to a restart costs a changed number on a screen,
because the device re-checks OTA every couple of minutes and displays
whatever the fresh reply carries.

It is shared between the device-facing handlers, which run on the
event loop, and the API handlers, which run on the threadpool, so
every operation happens under one mutex. The lock is held only for
in-memory work, microseconds of it, and never across a database write:
a claim reserves the code under the lock, writes with the lock
released, and consumes or releases the reservation afterwards. That is
what makes two operators racing one code produce one bind and one
retryable refusal rather than two binds.

Nothing here imports a device, a provider or a conversation: the
configuration API and `vinga-server config` are this table's second
reader, and what they may import without loading a conversation's
machinery is what this file is allowed to depend on.
