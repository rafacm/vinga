"""JSON control messages of the xiaozhi websocket protocol, both
directions.

Only the message types either side acts on are modelled. Anything else
parses to `UnknownMessage`, so a reader can log and move on, mirroring
the firmware, which logs JSON it does not understand and drops it.

The two halves are symmetric since #248, and the asymmetry that came
before is worth recording because it explains the shape. The
device-to-server half was modelled from the start; the server-to-device
half was three `json.dumps` calls, which is fine while the only reader is
the server, because a server never parses what it just wrote. `vinga
simulator run` is the first thing in this repository that READS the
server's half, and a client hand-rolling `data.get("type") == "tts"` would
be a second encoding of the wire in the one module whose whole
justification is that it holds none.

So both halves have models, both have a parser, and the three builders
are derived from the models rather than written beside them, which is
what stops the models and the wire from disagreeing.
