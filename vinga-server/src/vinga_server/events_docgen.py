"""The event surface's documentation, rendered from the declarations.

One source, two renderings, the discipline the domain configuration and
the conversation store already keep: every event is declared once, and
this reads the declarations as the markdown reference committed at
`docs/reference/events.md` and as what `vinga-server events reference`
prints. CI regenerates the committed copy and diffs it byte for byte, so
the document cannot say anything the declarations do not.

The declarations are the typed variants in `events/catalog.py`, and
There is no second description for this to read. A variant's class-level
facts, its declared values and the value types those name carry every
property the tables below print, which is the whole point of a
declaration that IS its emission: what a generator would have restated
is what a caller constructs.

That is what makes this the place field and token facts belong. The
README's event table used to carry them in prose nothing checked, which
reads as checked and is not; it is a name-and-when index now, and every
kind, token set, syntax and bound is here, where a wrong claim turns a
lane red.

Everything here is deterministic: no timestamps, no set iteration, and
the events, variants and fields come out in the catalog's own
declaration order. Token sets and channel sets are sorted, since those
are the only unordered things a declaration holds.

Read-only, and deliberately so: nothing here opens a database, reads a
configuration file, or needs a key. It imports the catalog and the
standard library, which is what lets the command in front of it run on a
machine whose server will not start.
