"""Recording a session to disk so it can be analysed offline.

`barge_in` misfiring (#28) is an acoustic defect. Nothing in the test
lanes can reproduce it: the unit lane feeds synthetic frames and the
integration lane drives a simulator over a websocket, and both bypass
the microphone, the board's echo cancellation, and the room. The
parameter that decides whether the assistant interrupts itself is how
much of its own voice survives the board's echo cancellation and reaches
the endpointer, and that number is unknown. Tuning against an invented
figure gives a fix that tests clean and fails on the street.

What was missing was not another test but the recording that lets the
tests be written against reality. Three files per session:

- `<session>.wav`, stereo 16 kHz s16le. Channel 0 is the decoded
  microphone as received, channel 1 is what was actually paced out to
  the speaker. Stereo rather than two files because alignment then
  costs nothing: sample N in both channels is the same instant, so echo
  leakage becomes a measurement (cross-correlate the channels, read off
  gain and delay) rather than a guess, and the overlap is directly
  audible in any audio editor.
- `<session>.jsonl`, the decision track: every structured event the
  session already emits, plus a `t_ms` offset that indexes into the WAV,
  plus the one thing the logs do not carry: the endpointer's opinion
  sampled continuously rather than only where it decided something. The
  frames dropped before the decode used to be the second such thing and
  are an ordinary event now (`frames_dropped`), counted by the emitter
  and read here through the tap like everything else.
- `<session>.json`, the manifest: what the capture was made against,
  because a capture outlives the code that made it.

Everything is stamped against the session's monotonic origin, so the
three files share one timeline.

This writes room audio to disk, which is the opposite of what the rest
of the project promises. It is off unless a directory is configured, and
says so on every session it records.

        off, `local_only` on or the extra gone builds no uploader at

        exactly the configurations an operator chose to stop exporting

        uploader or without one. A boot with no capture section builds
        no store either, and leaves the directory untouched: removing
        the section parks this with the rest of the capture machinery.
