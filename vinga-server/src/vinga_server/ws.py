"""The device websocket endpoint.

The path devices are sent to by the OTA reply; each accepted upgrade
becomes one `DeviceSession`, served with a conversation built by the
runtime factory the composition root assembled at startup.

Before any of that, the handshake is gated on the device token the OTA
reply issued. A connection that fails the gate is closed without ever
being accepted, which uvicorn answers as an HTTP 403 on the upgrade
rather than as a websocket close: that is what upstream does, and what
stock firmware handles by retrying and refreshing its token at its next
OTA check. The rejections that come after the accept (a malformed MAC,
a device bound to no agent) stay where M5 put them, inside the session,
because by then the device has proved who it is and the useful thing to
tell it is what is wrong with its configuration.
