"""What an MCP server ships about itself, captured under bounds.

The #122 guidance capture, whole: the `instructions` of a server's
initialize result and the prompts it publishes, walked, fetched,
rendered, bounded, and with this deployment's own materialized
values taken back out of them. A third party's words, so each is
captured only under a bound and none of it ever reaches a log.

Everything here takes the entry's name and its configuration as
arguments rather than reading a manager's fields: the manager
calls it at the points in its run where it always did, and what it
gets back is what to hold.

    The problem it answers is narrow and worth stating narrowly. An
    opted-in entry asks for a third party's words to reach a system
    prompt and a gated read, and that is the operator's decision; it is
    not a decision to let that server hand back the credential this
    deployment gave it, through a surface the rest of the API refuses to
    read a stored secret from. So the values that were materialized for
    this connection, and the secrets that went into them, are replaced.

    Both, because a materialized value is not always its own secret. A
    composed `Bearer $TOKEN` is handed to the server as `Bearer <token>`,
    and a server that reads its own Authorization header can hand back
    the token alone, which is a string no set of whole header values
    holds (#504).

    The two are taken separately rather than poured into one set,
    because only one of them is guesswork. `values` is whatever an entry
    configured and whatever it referenced under a key that says nothing
    about secrecy, so the length floor stands there: a short one is a
    string that might be anybody's, a marker or a locale as easily as a
    credential, and replacing it would mangle the guidance without
    protecting anything. `secrets` is not a guess. Each came out of a
    variable a SECRET-BEARING key referenced, which is this
    configuration's own classification, so a six-character one is a
    six-character credential and every non-empty one is replaced
    whatever its length. What that costs, at worst, is a few mangled
    occurrences of a short word under a key whose name says token or
    password; what the floor would cost there is the credential.

    Longest first, so that a value which contains another is replaced
    whole rather than left holding a placeholder in the middle of it.
    That rule is what makes a token inside its own composed value come
    out right: the header goes first and the bare token catches whatever
