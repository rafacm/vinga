"""One configured MCP server: its connection, its tools, and its
reconnection.

Each manager's whole lifecycle lives in one task: the SDK's clients
are async context managers over anyio task groups, and entering
them in one task while exiting in another is what breaks their
cancel scopes. The task connects, publishes its tools, and then
waits until asked to stop.

Beside the lifecycle sits what a reload needs of one manager: the
comparison that decides whether a connection stands, the bounded
stop, and the tasks that would not finish unwinding inside it.
