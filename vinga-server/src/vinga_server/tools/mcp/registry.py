"""Every MCP server some agent references, and the questions asked
of them together.

One manager per referenced `mcp_servers` entry, connected once at
startup and shared by every session whose agent names it, beside
the slice those managers were built for. What lives here is what
needs both halves: which tools an agent may reach right now, which
entry owns a published name, what an entry is doing, and the call
that carries out a decision a caller already made.

The reload's two phases are next door, in `reload.py`, and the
second of them reaches back through this class: the swap it makes is
this registry's own state. What is not here any more is when a reload
may run and how long it is held: one apply at a time is a property of
the whole configuration and not of the MCP half, so the exclusion
lives with the generalized apply that owns every half (#191).
