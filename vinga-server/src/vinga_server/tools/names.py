"""One tool namespace, with collisions impossible by construction.

Three sources of tools reach the same list, and the model sees one flat
set of names. Rather than detect collisions when the list is merged and
then have to invent a tie-break, the namespace is structural:

- builtins are bare (`switch_agent`, the memory family of `remember`,
  `update_memory`, `forget`, `restore_memory` and `recall`, `set_state`,
  `clear_state`, `new_conversation`, `resume_conversation`,
  `set_device_location`);
- the device's tools keep the firmware's `self.` prefix, with the dots
  sanitized away (`self_audio_speaker_set_volume`);
- an MCP server's tools carry their configuration entry name and a
  double underscore (`ha__turn_on_light`).

Configuration then forbids an `mcp_servers` entry from being called
`self` or from taking a builtin's name, which is what makes the three
groups disjoint. Routing a call back to its source reads the same
structure, so nothing has to be remembered about where a tool came from.

The one place the structure is not enough on its own is between two MCP
entries: an entry name may contain the separator, so `home` and
`home__inside` can publish the same name, and `owner_of` below settles
which of them a name belongs to.

A leaf module on purpose: the configuration layer validates entry names
against it, so it must not import anything that imports configuration.

# conversation tools and `set_device_location` are not here: none of
# them touches a memory. The last one is the one worth saying out loud,
# since it does write: where a device stands is a fact of the
# deployment rather than something an agent was told, so an agent that
# may not remember anything may still say its board has moved, for the
# reason it is still told its board's name.

# The tools whose order in a round is their meaning, so a reply may not
# run two of them at once.
#
# Every write a conversation makes to something that outlives the round
# is here, which is the smallest rule that is actually true. The obvious
# ones are addressed by an identity the model names: a key it chose for
# the ledger, a number it read out of a lookup. Two of those in one
# round can name the same thing, a set and a clear of `scene` or a
# correction and a removal of fact 7, and what is true afterwards is
# whichever ran last.
#
# `remember` looks like the exception and is not. It appends, so two of
# them leave both facts whichever order they land in, but a scope at its
# cap prunes on every write: a `remember` reordered ahead of a
# correction of the oldest fact deletes the row that correction just
# wrote and answers success to both. What couples them is the prune
# rather than the address, and a rule that let one mutation overtake
# another would have to know which scope was full to know whether it
# mattered.
#
# `set_device_location` is the one that is not a memory, and it is the
# plainest case of the rule rather than an exception to it: it writes
# one column of one row, addressed by the device the conversation is
# already on, so two calls in a round always name the same row. "You
# have been moved to the office, no, the landing" is one utterance a
# person really says, and what has to be true afterwards is the
# landing. Run concurrently, two writes take the domain writer lock in
# whatever order the pool hands the connections out, and the office
# would stand about half the time.
#
# So the model's order IS the answer for all of them, and a round that
# ran them concurrently would leave the database's lock arrival deciding
# it instead. Nothing else here has the property: a device tool and a
# server tool touch different worlds, `recall` changes nothing, and the
# three that move a session are resolved by the loop itself, in issue
# order, and never reach a dispatch at all.
