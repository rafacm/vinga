"""The three places a tool comes from, behind one interface.

The model is shown one flat list of tools per reply, and the runtime
that merged it knew each source by heart: which guard says a name is
this one's, which signature runs it, what that returns, and how long it
may take. Four conventions across two methods, one of them re-deriving
what another had already decided, and a fourth source would have added
a fifth convention.

What every source has in common is stated here instead. `ToolSource`
asks four questions: what do you offer this agent right now, is this
call yours, run it, and how long may it take. The runtime keeps exactly
what no source can answer: a call whose arguments never parsed as an
object, a name no source claims, and the three tools that end the tool
loop rather than producing a result the model reads, which are
`switch_agent` and the two that move a session to another
conversation.

Routing is decided once and then carried. Every question below is asked
about the same CLAIM, the classification the runtime reserved on the
turn's record before anything ran, so MCP routing never resolves a name
a second time (the device source deliberately re-scans its live tool
list at ownership, the recorded edge behavior it inherited). An MCP
reload landing between the reservation and the call can move a
published name to a more specific entry, and a source that
re-read the name would run one server's tool under another server's
timeout and then record the entry that did not run it. The claim is
what makes that impossible rather than unlikely.

The namespace in `names` is what makes the order the runtime asks in a
precedence rather than a scramble: builtins are bare, the device's
tools carry its prefix, an MCP server's carry their entry's, and
configuration forbids an entry from taking either of the other two
groups' names. No two sources can own one name, so asking them in a
fixed order settles nothing that was ever in doubt.

    Owns every builtin name whether or not it can run. A builtin this

    is this source saying there is no such tool, in the same words the
    runtime uses for a name nobody publishes: the classification says
    which namespace the model reached into, and whether the call then
    ran is what the result says.

    Three of them are offered here and executed by the runtime, because
    what they do is end the tool loop rather than produce a result the
    model reads: `switch_agent` moves the conversation to another agent,
    `new_conversation` and a `resume_conversation` naming a thread move
    it to another conversation. `switch_agent` and `new_conversation`
    reach `dispatch` only if that handling ever stops catching them, and
    are answered as the builtin that cannot run.

    The two conversation tools are offered whether or not this server
    can resume anything, which is the point of the refusal they answer
    with: a tool that is simply absent is a tool a model invents, and a
    refusal it can read out is something the user hears.

    The memory family is offered wherever the agent's own `memory`
    section leaves it on, which is everywhere it says nothing: memory
    lives in a schema this server migrates at every boot (#314), so
    there is no deployment without one and the default is on. `remembers`
    is that condition, and it is the whole of it. An agent switched off
    is offered none of the seven and is answered as a name this server
    does not publish if it asks for one anyway, which is the same words
    a builtin that cannot run is refused with: for the length of that
    reply the tool does not exist, and saying so twice differently would
    be telling the model two things.

    A callable rather than a value for the reason `context` is one, and
    it answers what the reply resolved rather than what the world
    currently says: the policy has one clock per reply, taken where the
    snapshot is, so that the tools this offers and the blocks that
    reply's prompt carries cannot come from two halves of a reload.

    `context` is what every one of those tools is addressed by: a
    callable rather than a value, because a reply can move a session to
    another conversation and a note written after that move belongs to
    the thread the session is on now. It is a constructor concern of this
    one source rather than a widening of `ToolSource`: the protocol asks
    what every source has to answer, and where a session's memory lives
    is not one of those questions.

    `threads` is the search half of the resumption flow, absent in every
    deployment that has not switched resumption on and compared
    `is not None` for that reason.

    `relocations` and `record` are the location tool's two halves, and
    they are two arguments rather than one bound object because the two
    absences mean different things to whoever is in the room: a server
    that cannot write device records at all is one nobody will give a
    device record to while this conversation is happening, and a device
    with no record is one an operator can bind. `record` is the id of
    the record this conversation attached to, fixed for the life of it,
    which is why it is a value where `context` is a callable: a reply
    can move a session to another conversation and it can never move it
    to another device.
