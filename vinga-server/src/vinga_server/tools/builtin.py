"""The tools the server implements itself.

Eleven of them, all bare-named because the namespace rules in `names`
reserve those names. Nine are executed here: the memory family
(`remember`, `update_memory`, `forget`, `restore_memory` and `recall`)
and the ledger's two (`set_state`, `clear_state`), against the memory
store, the search half of `resume_conversation`, against whatever
the runtime injected as its way of reading stored threads, and
`set_device_location`, against the configuration repository. The other
two are defined here and executed by the session, because what they do
is end the tool loop rather than produce a result the model reads:
`switch_agent` hands the conversation to another agent, and
`new_conversation` and the selection half of `resume_conversation` move
it to another thread.

What the memory tools write is injected by `runtime.prompt`, which is
where the whole system prompt is assembled: this module defines and runs
the tools, and how their output reaches the model is the runtime's. The
injected blocks carry no numbers, which is why `recall` answers with
them: it is how the model reaches both what the prompt left out and the
number anything it wants to change is addressed by.

`set_device_location` is the one that writes something an operator can
also write, and it writes it the way an operator's command does, through
the configuration repository, so that the rules about what a stored
device location may be are stated once. It reaches nothing else: the
record it moves is the one this conversation attached to, and the module
below never sees a database.

The tools that write memory need to know which memory they are writing,
which is what `MemoryContext` is: the session's memory address as a
value, asked for at the moment a call runs rather than kept from when
the source was built, because a reply can move a session to another
thread. The device is what a fact about the place is kept under and
which memories a number may reach; the thread is what a ledger entry
belongs to and which conversation an undo is bounded by. Neither is ever
read out of a call's arguments, because a model that could name one
would be writing into another household's notes or another
conversation's ledger.

The sentences a selection answers with also live here, all of them, and
that is deliberate rather than tidy. They are one closed vocabulary,
half of it chosen where a tool is dispatched and half of it where the
runtime intercepts one, and a vocabulary split across the two modules
that speak it would be two vocabularies inside a month. Every one of
them is a fixed sentence with nothing in it that a room said: what the
model is told is what happened and what to do about it.

    speaker, the reason the memory tools read their owner off the
    session rather than out of their arguments.

    Two things are in the description because a reader and a model both
    have to see them. The first is the trust stance, settled by #449:
    any voice in the room may move this device, because being in the
    room is already what talking to it takes, and a permission that is
    not stated in the one place the model reads is a permission nobody
    can check. The second is the mutability split this whole record is
    built around: a conversation may say where the device IS and may
    not say what it is CALLED, because the name is identity an operator
    manages and the location is context the household changes.

    Offered to every agent, whether or not this server can write one,
    for the reason the two conversation tools are: a tool that is
    simply absent is a tool a model invents, and an agent with nowhere
    to write this would otherwise answer "moved to the office" with
    "all right" and change nothing, which is the one answer worse than
    a refusal.
