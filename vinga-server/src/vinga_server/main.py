"""The command line entry point: which of the five things to do.

Four command words that configure, report or diagnose, and everything
else is the server. This module holds the dispatch and the sentences a
mistake in front of it gets, and nothing about any of the five: each
group is imported inside the branch that reaches it.

That was already true of the four command words, for a reason of their
own (a document saying what the events are must not need a server that
starts). Since the dependency split it is true of serving as well, and
for the reason this file exists to make possible. The default
installation of this package is the configuration client: pydantic,
httpx, typer, PyYAML and dotenv, and none of FastAPI, uvicorn,
SQLAlchemy, cryptography, the LLM SDKs or the audio stack. Serving is
`vinga_server.serving`, which imports all of them and subclasses
`uvicorn.Server` at import time, so an installation without the server
half cannot import that module at all. It is reached in the serve branch
alone, and an installation that cannot reach it is answered with one
fixed sentence rather than an ImportError traceback naming a module
path.
