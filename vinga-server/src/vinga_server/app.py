# the three names below are the boot failure taxonomy in full: every one
# of them carries a message written to be printed as it is, which is what
# lets the bridge below hand one sentence to an operator and nothing
# else.
#
# `McpConfigError` is here because it is a boot refusal like the others
# and was reaching the operator like a bug: an entry missing its egress
# declaration under `server.local_only`, or naming an environment
# variable nothing sets, answered with uvicorn's traceback and exit code
# 3 rather than the sentence and exit code 1 its message was written for.
# It is a `ValueError` rather than a `ConfigError` and stays one, since
# the reload path catches it beside `ConfigError` by name and re-parenting
# it would change what a `ValueError` means to every caller of the MCP
# layer; naming it here is the smaller and more honest change.

    as itself would therefore print its exception chain to stderr, and a
    chain from this depth can carry a credential: a driver's message
    quotes the URL it could not reach, a client library's quotes what it
    was configured with.

    So the taxonomy is caught, its already-sanitized sentence is recorded
    on the seed for `main()` to print, and this is raised in its place,

    deliberately the smallest thing that works: the configuration and the

    The configuration API's token is NOT here. It is resolved in the
    describe phase and passed straight into the gate, which is the
    standing exception this project already made for it, and a copy on
    this object would be a second place it lives (the plan review's

    `failure` is written by the lifespan when the build refuses: the
    sanitized sentence, for `main()` to print after `serve()` returns.

    `stop_admitting` travels the other way, and is written by the
    shutdown: a signal that arrives while this build is still running has

    """What the configuration API's diff read calls.

    Closed over here for the reason the reload is: the holder whose
    generation is what this server is serving, and the registry a reload
    replaces, are known at the composition root and nowhere else, and
    the API application must not learn which kind of configuration
    converges where.

    The running side is read from the holder at the moment the
    comparison is composed rather than captured when this is built. That
    is the whole of what makes the answer keep its promise once a reload
    can apply something: a comparison against the boot would report as
    pending exactly the changes an apply has already made, which is the
    one thing an answer about what is pending must not do.

    `read` is the stored half, handed in rather than done here, exactly
    as the reload hands its own re-read to the registry: opening a
    database belongs to the layer that owns one, and what this function
    owns is where that read runs and what makes its answer one world.
    The composition root passes `reload_domain_config`, which is the
    settled decision that the diff's stored side is the reload's own
    re-read: the same migration, the same verification that every stored
    credential opens, and the same whole-snapshot validation, so a
    stored half that fails that read is refused here under the status it
    would be refused under there.

    That is the whole of the equivalence, and it is worth being exact
    about which direction it runs in, since the other one is tempting
    and false. A stored half this refuses is a stored half a reload
    refuses, because they fail in the same function. A stored half this
    answers is not a reload that would apply: the reload has a second
    phase this has no part of, which builds a manager per referenced
    entry and refuses on an environment reference nothing sets, a
    credential a transport cannot use, or an entry `server.local_only`
    forbids. None of those is a comparison question, and none of them is
    answered here.

    One world, and this is the whole of how. The read is blocking (it
    takes the database's write lock and waits out its busy timeout), so
    it runs in a worker thread, and that await is itself the window: a
    reload can install a new world while it is in flight, leaving a
    stored generation compared against a runtime that never held it. The
    holder's mark is therefore taken on this loop before the read and
    read again after it, and the comparison runs only if it was settled
    both times and did not move, with no await of its own between that
    check and the answer. An apply changes serving state more than once,
    so the mark reads as nothing at all while one is running, and a
    sample that has no number is as good a reason to read again as two
    that disagree. A mark that keeps moving refuses with the retryable
    409 rather than composing a mixture.

    A refused read keeps its type and loses its words. The type is what
    the API turns into a status and is the store's own; the sentence is
    replaced by one of the three fixed ones above, because the store
    composes its sentences over the state it refused and this read's
    answers carry names and labels and nothing else. A failure with no
    type at all is a bug and is left alone: the API's last-resort

    conversation to show its ledger, would be a second prompt assembler
    pretending to be the first. The route's own description says so where
    a caller reads it.

    Agent-keyed also means the agent's own `memory` section applies: one
    that may not remember is previewed with no block and costs no read,
    which is the prompt a reply of that agent's carries.

    (the file named by VINGA_CONFIG plus the domain half from the
    database), which is what an external ASGI server gets; the CLI reads
    it itself (it also honours --config) and passes both halves in.

    `secrets` are the stored credentials the snapshot was loaded with,
    None for a configuration whose credentials are all environment
    references. They reach exactly the two places a credential is
    materialized: building a provider, and connecting an MCP server.

    `on_started` is called once the lifespan has built everything and
    before the first request, and is how the CLI says out loud where to
    point a device. None for an app built by a test lane or an external
    ASGI runner, which has no operator reading its startup output.

    `from_store` says whether the configuration handed in was read from
    the database, which is true of both production entry points and
    false of an embedded caller composing one in Python. It decides
    whether device bindings resolve live from the database or from the
    snapshot, authoritatively: a server that was handed its world is a
    server whose world no store describes, and reading a store that
    describes some other deployment would answer the right question
    about the wrong server. It is stated by the caller rather than
    probed here, because it is a fact about how this application was
    composed. Reading it here when the config is None is not an
    exception to that: `create_app()` with nothing composes from the
    store itself, two lines below.

    Nothing here opens a database, starts a thread or loads a model: an
    app that is described and never served holds nothing (#142). What it
