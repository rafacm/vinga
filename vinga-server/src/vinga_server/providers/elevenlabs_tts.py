"""Cloud text to speech on ElevenLabs, streamed as raw PCM.

No SDK and no extra: the streaming endpoint is one POST whose response
body is the audio, so `httpx` (already a dependency) covers it, and a
cloud provider carries none of the weight or licensing that makes the
local engines optional (#11).

`output_format` asks the API for signed 16-bit little-endian mono at a
named rate, which is exactly what this stage's interface passes along,
so the default `pcm_24000` matches the device output rate and the
session's resampler has nothing to do. The API bills by character and
the request carries the reply text, so the type reaches the internet.

What this type accepts is declared once, as `ElevenlabsOptions` in
`config/provider_options.py`, and reaches the builder below already
validated. Both rules this type used to enforce by hand are stated
there: a voice id that is present and not blank, and an output format
this stage can stream. The `voice_settings` mapping was the last
hand-rolled options ladder in this package, a key table and two type
checks; it is a nested model now, with the same five keys and the same
refusal of a sixth (#88).
