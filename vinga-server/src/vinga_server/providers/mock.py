    streamed word by word so sentence assembly is exercised. The template
    takes `{text}` (the last user turn), `{system}` (the prompt the
    session handed over, so a test can prove a reply came from one
    agent's own prompt and not another's), `{tools}` (the names this
    reply was offered, the same trick `{system}` plays for the prompt:
    what a session gave the model is otherwise invisible from outside,
    so a test about which tools an agent may reach could only watch
    which calls happened, and a forbidden tool nobody called would pass)
    and `{tool_result}` (whatever the tools answered this reply).

    Tool calling is scripted rather than decided: when `tool_when` is a
    substring of the last user turn, the first round asks for
    `tool_name` with `tool_arguments` and says nothing, and the round
    after the results come back speaks the template. That makes the
    whole loop deterministic, which is what the acceptance test needs.
    Without the tool options this behaves exactly as it did before.

    Two options extend the script to the flows where one call answers
    the next, which a template cannot express because the argument is a
    value only the previous result holds.

    `then_pattern` and `then_arguments` are the second beat: once the
    results are back, a first capturing group matched against them is
    substituted for `{found}` in each argument, and the same tool is
    asked for again. That is how a two-argument tool (search, then pick
    what the search answered) is driven end to end without teaching this
    double to read.

    `tool_unless` is the brake: no call at all where that text appears
    anywhere in the turns this model was handed. A script keyed on what
    it has already seen is what makes the utterance after a successful
    flow an ordinary one, in a lane where every utterance transcribes
    the same."""
