"""The provider interfaces behind the conversation pipeline.

One small interface per stage: VAD segments speech, ASR transcribes,
the LLM streams a reply, TTS streams audio. Implementations register a
type name in `vinga_server.providers.registry` and are configured
through the named entries under `providers` in the YAML configuration;
which implementation serves a session is the agent's choice.

All PCM crossing these interfaces is s16le mono: endpointers are fed
the pipeline rate of 16 kHz, ASR is told the rate per call, and TTS
announces the rate it produces.

    type whose configuration decides (an openai_compatible base_url can
    name localhost or a vendor), which under `server.local_only` demands
    an explicit `egress` declaration on the provider entry (#30).

    There is no default. Every concrete type declares its own marking in
