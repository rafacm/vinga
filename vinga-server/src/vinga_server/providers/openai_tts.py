"""Text to speech over the OpenAI speech API, streamed as raw PCM.

No SDK to add and no extra: `openai` is already a core dependency,
installed for the `openai_compatible` LLM provider, and speech is a
method on the client that already ships. One key therefore serves both
stages for a deployment already on OpenAI (#11).

`base_url` is the same door the `openai_compatible` LLM type opens:
several self-hosted speech servers implement `/v1/audio/speech`, so
pointing this type at one keeps a fully local pipeline available
through the same dialect. It defaults to OpenAI itself, and it is what
decides whether this provider sends anything off the host, which is
why the type cannot declare its own reach.

`response_format="pcm"` is the only format this stage can pass through,
and the API defines it as signed 16-bit little-endian mono at 24 kHz
with no header, which is exactly this stage's interface and the rate
devices are spoken at. It is not an option for that reason: the other
formats are containers that would have to be decoded just to be
re-encoded, costing a dependency and latency.

The request carries the reply text, so wherever the base_url points is
where the reply text goes.
