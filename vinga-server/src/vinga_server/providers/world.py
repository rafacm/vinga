"""The engines one world runs on: built, owned, and let go of.

Building a provider used to be a thing a server did once. The object
that came back lived as long as the process, so nobody owned it after
the boot and nothing was ever released; a failure part way through the
boot simply took the process with it. Applying stored configuration
without a restart ends both of those (#191): an entry an apply rewrote
is built again, the object the old world spoke through has to be told
its world is over, and a build that refuses happens while a server is
serving conversations and must leave them exactly as they were.

So ownership is total here, and it begins the instant an allocation
succeeds rather than when a finished world is handed over. Three rules
carry it:

- Options are read and finished before anything is constructed, in the
  provider modules themselves, so a trailing unknown option refuses
  without a model having been loaded.
- One provider is constructed at a time, off the loop, and the object it
  returns transfers into this module before anything can refuse it. The
  egress check therefore runs here, on the loop, inside the owner that
  is already holding the object, so a refusal closes what it just built
  instead of dropping it.
- Every exit that is not an install closes what this build constructed,
  exactly once, and nothing is left to the garbage collector. A later
  entry's failure, a preparation whose caller went away, a boot that
  refuses: all one path.

What is deliberately not owned here is a carried-over provider. An entry
whose model and stored credentials are unchanged is the object it
already was, and the world that built it goes on holding it: reuse
transfers a share of ownership rather than making a second one, which is
why a failed build closes what it constructed and never what it kept.

Disposal is the other half and is written to be unrefusable. It runs
after the world has already moved, so a `close` that raises cannot fail
anything: it is bounded, classified by exception class with the prose
dropped, and the caller carries on. The only thing it waits for is work:
a provider's own `close` waits out the worker threads still inside it,
which is what keeps an engine reachable until the transcription that was
already running has finished with it.
