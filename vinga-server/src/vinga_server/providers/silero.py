"""End-of-utterance detection on Silero VAD.

pysilero-vad compiles the Silero model and its ONNX runtime into one
small wheel with no Python dependencies, which is why this is a core
dependency rather than an extra. The endpointer keeps the M3 feed/reset
shape and bookkeeping (trailing-silence window after speech, utterance
cap), but decides speech per 512-sample window by Silero probability
instead of signal energy.

        it carry the assistant's own playback echo into the pause after
        a reply. `SileroVoiceActivityDetector.reset()` is exactly this
        and no more: the model keeps no accounting of its own, so the
        bookkeeping above is untouched and an utterance already in

        under the threshold before the score climbs back over it,
