"""The plumbing every provider that reaches a network needs.

Five provider types make requests, and each of them used to answer the
same handful of questions in its own module: which credential to send,
how long to wait, how many attempts a failure is worth, how to hand a
stream of bytes on sample-aligned, and how a failed request should
look to the caller. Three of them imported the credential resolver from
the Anthropic provider, which made whichever provider happened to be
written first the home of a decision belonging to none of them, and the
timeout default was declared three times over (#137).

The taxonomy those providers raise is deliberately not here.
`ProviderCallError` and `ProviderCallTimeout` are contract rather than
plumbing: the pipeline classifies by them, so they live with the rest
of the provider contract in `base.py`. What this module adds is the one
place that turns an SDK's exception into one of them.
