"""Local speech recognition on faster-whisper (CTranslate2).

The optional `faster-whisper` extra provides this module's engine:
`uv sync --extra faster-whisper`. Model weights download from Hugging
Face into the local cache when the provider is built, which is server
startup, so the first conversation does not pay for the download.

Whisper is multilingual, and per-utterance language detection is its
single most expensive habit on a CPU: a constant encoder pass over a
padded 30 s window, measured at several seconds per turn on small
hardware, with a misdetection sending the decoder into territory that
costs more again (#22). The `language` option pins one language and
skips all of that at the price of monolingual deployment; the
`language_detect`, `language_fallback` and `language_confidence_floor`
options are the middle ground, detecting when needed and trusting a
detection only as far as its confidence earns.

What this type accepts is declared once, as `FasterWhisperOptions` in
`config/provider_options.py`, and reaches the builder below already
validated. The decode options mirror `WhisperModel.transcribe`
arguments of the same name and keep the engine's defaults when unset,
with one exception: `beam_size` defaults to greedy decoding (1),
because beam search buys little accuracy on short spoken commands and
costs a multiple of the CPU time (#19).
