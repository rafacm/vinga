"""Constructing providers from their configuration entries.

Every provider type is written down once, in
`config/provider_options.py`: where its factory lives and what it
accepts. This module turns that into `Registration`s, resolving a
factory name into a callable at the moment a provider is built, so the
core install only pays for the engines a configuration references and a
missing optional dependency becomes an error naming the extra to
install rather than an ImportError from the middle of a request.

Construction only. What owns the objects, checks them and lets go of
them again is `providers/world.py`, which is the half that cannot run in
a worker thread: refusing a provider that already exists means closing
it (#191).

    are written down: this resolves that entry's factory name into
    something callable and carries its model along unchanged. There is

    nor a database driver, and reaching this module means importing the
    provider package, so the table lives where the light readers can
    reach it and the resolving happens here, where the engines are.

    The factory comes in two shapes, and which one is which is decided
    by `options` rather than by a flag: a type that declares a model is
    called `(label, config, options)` and reads attributes off a
    validated instance, and a type that declares none is called
    `(label, config)` and reads its own `OptionsReader` ladder, exactly
