"""Replies from any OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint.

This is the door to local and self-hosted models: Ollama, LM Studio,
llama.cpp servers, and API gateways all speak this dialect. `base_url`
is required for that reason; pointing it at api.openai.com works too.
Endpoints that need no key (Ollama) get a placeholder, since the SDK
insists on one.

What this type accepts is declared once, as `OpenaiCompatibleOptions` in
`config/provider_options.py`, and reaches the builder below already
validated. It is the one declaration whose door stays open, and this is
the module that makes the opening mean something: an option the model
does not declare is not dropped and not refused, it rides into the
outgoing request body through the SDK's own `extra_body`, under the
fields this module composes for every call (#88).
