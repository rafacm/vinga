"""Speech to text over the OpenAI transcription API.

The third of the cloud providers in issue #11, and the first that is
not a voice: multilingual accuracy better than a local `small` model,
without provisioning a GPU or downloading weights. No SDK to add and no
extra, for the reason the `openai` TTS type has none: the `openai`
client is already a core dependency, carried for the
`openai_compatible` LLM type, and transcription is a method on the
client that already ships. One key therefore serves all three stages.

`base_url` is the same door the other two `openai` types open. Several
self-hosted servers implement `/v1/audio/transcriptions`, so pointing
this type at one keeps a fully local pipeline available through the
same dialect. It defaults to OpenAI itself, and it is what decides
whether this provider sends anything off the host, which is why the
type cannot declare its own reach.

**This provider does not stream, and does not need to.** #11 asks a
network provider to stream or to justify not streaming. The stage's
interface is one whole utterance in, one whole transcript out, because
the LLM stage cannot begin on half a sentence; and the utterance is
already complete before `transcribe` is called, since the endpointer is
what decides the call happens. Streaming the response would therefore
deliver text deltas nothing downstream can consume, a turn's worth of
latency earlier than the turn can use them. The TTS stage is the
opposite case, and streams.

**This provider does not detect language, and that costs nothing it
would otherwise buy.** The model still recognises whatever is spoken
when `language` is unset; what is missing is the *report* of which
language that was, because the transcription response only carries one
for `whisper-1` asked for `verbose_json`, as an English name
("swedish") rather than the ISO code the rest of the pipeline speaks,
and no model reports a confidence at all. `AsrResult`'s language fields
are therefore left empty rather than filled with a guess, and the
session-scoped lock (`lock_language`) is never asked for. The lock
exists to spare faster-whisper a constant encoder pass per utterance
(#22); here detection happens inside the model at no measurable cost,
so there is nothing to spare.
