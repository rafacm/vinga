"""Local text to speech on Piper.

The optional `piper` extra provides the engine: `uv sync --extra
piper`. piper-tts (the maintained piper1-gpl) is GPL-3.0, which is why
it is an extra and never a core dependency. Voices come from the Piper
voice collection on Hugging Face, downloaded into `download_dir` when
the provider is built, at server startup; the voice's native sample
rate (22.05 kHz for the medium voices) is announced through the
provider and resampled by the session.
