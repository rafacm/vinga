"""One turn of a conversation, held over a real websocket, as a board
holds it.

The device's leg of the xiaozhi protocol: the handshake and its four
headers, the hello exchange, one utterance of the packaged Opus paced the
way a microphone would deliver it, and reading until the reply ends or a
bound expires. Half duplex and no barge-in, which is what a simulator
with no playback can honestly be.

**This module holds no copy of the protocol.** The messages are
`protocol/messages.py`'s models, built and parsed by that module's own
functions; the framing is `protocol/framing.py`; the audio is
`simulator/utterance.py`. What is here is the ORDERING, which is the one
thing neither of those knows.

**The ordering is a machine, not a sequence of reads.** A simulator that
took messages in whatever order they arrived could not say what went
wrong, so the eight states below are declared with their transitions, and
two rules make it a machine rather than a list. A message that arrives in
a state that does not expect it is reported by this side's own name for
it and advances nothing, which is what the firmware does with JSON it
does not understand. And every transition that waits has a bound, so no
state can be waited in forever.

**Nothing the far side wrote reaches a sentence**, and this is the module
where that is hardest, because everything here came from the far side.
The exceptions that prove the rule are the transcript and the reply's
sentences, which are the artifact this command exists to print. Beside
them: the close code is a number compared against a closed set and
reported by this side's word for it, the close reason is read and
discarded, an unmodelled message type is named as unmodelled rather than
quoted, and every websockets exception is reported by its class alone,
recorded inside its handler and raised outside it.

**The only `websockets` import in `src/` is here**, which is what makes
the `[sim]` extra a real gate: `config/cli` reaches this module inside
`run`'s own arm, and nothing else in the package imports it at all. An
`__init__` that re-exported this would drag the dependency into every
import of the simulator package, which is the gate defeating itself.
