"""A device-facing address a person typed, and what it takes to reach one.

Two commands stand where a board stands. `vinga-server doctor` GETs an
OTA endpoint and says what a device pointed there would be told;
`vinga simulator` POSTs to one as a board does. They ask different
questions of the same kind of address, and the rules for talking to one
are the same rules whichever of them is asking.

Those rules are here rather than in either caller, because the surface
they govern is the one where a mistake is a leak. A supplied OTA URL can
be the deployment's secret `ota_path`, so no sentence repeats it; the
request itself is a place a library writes that URL into a log record
and puts it on an exception; and a second implementation of any of that
would be a second chance to get it wrong, on exactly the surface that
must not be got wrong twice.

What this owns:

- **A parsed endpoint, not a string.** `Endpoint` keeps the address as
  it was given and the parsed parts beside it, so composition is an
  operation rather than string arithmetic: `activation()` appends the
  segment a waiting board polls to the PATH and carries the query and
  the fragment through untouched. That is the discipline
  `config/cli.Address.endpoint` uses on the API side, and it exists here
  for the same reason: a client that joins a path onto an address with
  a query string on it sends the endpoint's name inside the query's
  value.
- **The address policy**, which is the device-facing one and not the
  configuration client's. A plain `http://` address is ordinary here
  rather than refused, because that is exactly what a board on a LAN is
  pointed at, and the request that goes to it carries no credential at
  all: the OTA endpoint is the token issuer, so it cannot require one.
  What does apply is the rest: a URL that cannot be read is refused, and
  a userinfo is refused rather than carried.
- **The stand-in name** every verdict uses instead of the address, and
  the redaction that keeps far-side text from putting the address back:
  `Endpoint.repeated` is the one door the few fields these commands DO
  show go through, because an endpoint that reflects the request target
  into an answer would otherwise publish the segment no sentence prints.
- **The request lifecycle**: one request, no redirect followed, the
  request loggers held quiet around it, the client built inside the
  boundary, the close reported rather than raised, and every failure a
  fixed sentence naming an exception's class and never a value.
- **The websocket URL rule**, since it is the same question asked of a
  different address: what a reply names is where a token this process is
  holding would be sent.

`config/cli.Address` is deliberately not reused, and the reason is
recorded so it is not rediscovered. Nothing under `vinga_server` may
import `config.cli` except `main.py`, and the two types' transport
policies are opposites: one refuses plain HTTP off loopback because the
API's bearer token rides every request, and this one has to allow it.

    fallback to the raw string. A URL that will not parse is exactly the
    one whose userinfo could not be taken off, so falling back would
    print the credential in precisely the case the stripping exists for.

    It carries no userinfo, refused outright for the reason
    `Endpoint.parsed` refuses one: a credential in a URL reaches shell
    history, process lists and access logs, and a client that connected
    anyway would be the thing that published it.

    answer with a `ws://` URL, which is the TLS-proxy misconfiguration

    crossing a plain socket from behind TLS is the same mistake the
    configuration client has no flag to make.
