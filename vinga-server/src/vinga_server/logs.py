"""Logging setup: the human format, and the JSON one.

Two formats, one handler on the root logger. `text` is what a terminal
wants and what the server has always printed. `json` is one object per
line, which is what a log collector wants, and it is the container
default: the conversation events carry structured fields a collector
can group by session, so a deployment measures its own pipeline from
what it retains. They carry metadata only; the record of what was said
is the conversation store (#120).

One thing is filtered rather than formatted: the libraries that carry
somebody else's bytes are held below the server's level, because their
debug records carry response headers, request lines, frame payloads and
tracebacks nothing here has sanitized. See `quiet_vendor_libraries`
below, which is called from here and, without a level, from the two
places a deployment starts at, because one of them never reaches this
function and the other reaches it after the boot configuration has
already been read out of a database. `quieted` beside it is the same
mechanism for the length of one call, which is what a command whose
argument is a secret needs of the library that would narrate it.

Call sites need no wrapper. Anything passed as `extra=` on an ordinary
logging call becomes a top-level field of the JSON object, found by
comparing the record's attributes against the ones `logging` itself
sets. The message text stays a plain human sentence in both formats,
so nothing is only readable as JSON.

Stdlib only, deliberately: the formatter is short enough that a
structured-logging dependency would cost more than it saves.

# The libraries that render somebody else's bytes into a record of their
# own, and the level below which each of them reaches this handler.
#
# Their debug records are the one surface the taxonomies cannot reach. A
# provider sanitizes what it raises (providers/kit.py) and this server's
# own lines say only what their call site decided to say, but a library
# in the middle narrates the wire, and `server.log_level: DEBUG` is a
# reasonable thing to turn on while diagnosing one: that is all it would
# take to put the lot into the logs the observability ADR makes the
# retained surface.
#
# What each of them narrates:
#
# - The far side of a provider call. The openai and anthropic clients
#   log the request options, the response headers verbatim and the
#   traceback of anything they caught, with httpx and httpcore tracing
#   the connection underneath. A response header is written by the far
#   end, so a compatible endpoint can echo a credential or the request's
#   own content into one.
# - The near side of every request served. `uvicorn.error` carries the
#   HTTP server's trace, which at debug is the request line and every
#   request header: the OTA path holds the deployment's secret segment
#   and a device's handshake carries its bearer token, which is why the
#   access log is off in the first place (`serving.uvicorn_config` says
#   so). uvicorn hands that same logger to the websockets protocol, so
#   those records also render every device frame's payload, text
#   decoded.
#
# The MCP SDK narrates its wire the same way, and is deliberately not
# here: `tools/mcp/transport.py` takes its whole namespace off this
# handler entirely (`quiet_sdk_loggers`), which is stronger than a
# floor and is owned by the module that connects with it. A floor here
# as well would be a second rule to keep in agreement with that one.
#
# INFO for the SDKs and for uvicorn, because what each says at that
# level is worth keeping and carries none of it: uvicorn's startup and
# per-connection lines, and the SDKs' notice that a request is being
# retried, which names the endpoint's path and not its query.
#
# The HTTP clients and the database are at WARNING, because INFO is
# where a payload of somebody else's composing starts.
#
# httpx writes one line per request at INFO: the method, the full URL
# with its query string, and the status. Nothing in it is secret today,
# since every provider this server speaks to authenticates in a header
# and a header is not on that line. But the line is composed by the
# library rather than by code anyone here audited, it sits outside the
# closed event vocabulary the rest of the log is held to, and a provider
# that one day carries a key or a session id in a query string would
# have it logged verbatim. What holding it back loses is a line per
# request, and with it a failed call's status code. What it keeps is
# `provider_failed`, whose fields are closed (the stage, the provider
# entry with its type and model, the host, the duration and the
# exception's class name), and whose `host` is the one part of the URL
# worth retaining. httpcore writes nothing above DEBUG today and is held
# with httpx, so that whatever it ever starts saying at INFO about the
# same connection is held to the same rule.
#
# sqlalchemy, because an engine whose logger is enabled for INFO echoes
# every statement with the parameters bound to it, and those parameters
# are the stored configuration and, once #120 lands, what was said. The
# library pins its own logger at WARNING when it is imported, and this
# is deliberately not a reliance on that.
#
# There is no configuration key to lift these, and deliberately so. A
# diagnosis that genuinely needs one raises it by name in the process
# that needs it, after this has run
# (`logging.getLogger("httpx").setLevel(logging.INFO)` brings the request
# line back), which is a deliberate act rather than a side effect of the
# server's own level. A request that carries a secret in its URL holds
# these two loggers quiet around itself as well (`quieted` below), so
# lifting the floor does not lift that.

# loud level, the second saved the quiet one, and the first to LEAVE
# restores the loud level underneath a request the second is still
# making, so the library narrates that request's URL into a record after
# all. The pair then finishes with the level the second saved, which is

# what has to be atomic is the span from raising the level to putting it
# back, not the setLevel calls at its ends. Reentrant, so a caller
# already inside one boundary may open another; the callers here do not
# nest today, and a lock that deadlocked if they ever did would be a
# trap left for somebody else to find.
#
# What this costs is that two threads quieting the same loggers take
# their turns rather than overlapping. Both callers are command-line
