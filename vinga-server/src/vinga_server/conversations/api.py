"""The conversation store on the gated /api: three namespaces over one
set of rows.

`/sessions` answers connection episodes and `/conversations` answers
durable threads, and they are two readings of the same turns rather than
two stores: a turn names both, so one session's turns can belong to
several threads and one thread's turns can come from several sessions.
Three reads and two erasures each, with the erasures asymmetric on
purpose (see `threads.erase_conversations`).

`/metrics` is the third reading and answers about days rather than
about either: the named aggregates `views.py` declares, served over a
window of whole UTC days to the readers who are not SQL clients. An
analyst with a Postgres connection reads the views directly and needs
none of it. It erases nothing and addresses nothing by an id; what a
request names is which question and over which days, and the question
is named by a word that resolves through a closed mapping derived from
the declarations, because a relation name cannot be a bound parameter.
The grouping beside it says which of two relations answers that
question, the ungrouped view or its per-device sibling, and it resolves
through the same kind of mapping for the same reason. That word, the
grouping, the device a per-device read may be narrowed to and both days
are resolved before anything is opened, so a refusal there has reached
no connection: the read takes the opener rather than an open connection
and enters it around the one statement it is for.

The route functions live here and are registered by `config/api.py`'s
`_application()`, which is the application `document()` renders and the
one the server mounts, so a route cannot be served without being in the
committed contract. What travels the other way is only runtime fact: the
database connection, attached by `build_api` as the per-request reader
below. Registration takes `_problems` as an argument rather than
importing it, because the configuration API imports this module and the
import may not go both ways.

Nothing here decides what is stored. The writer applies the storage
switches (`store.py`), the schema says what a column means
(`schema.py`), and a content column comes back exactly as it was
written: null where text storage was off, with the session's own `text`
flag beside it saying which reading the null deserves.

Three transport rules the routes hold to:

- **A cursor is plain values a caller can read, never an encoding to
  version.** Three of the four listings page on the monotonic row ids
  alone: the session list backwards (`id` strictly below the cursor,
  newest first) and both timelines forwards (`id` strictly after it),
  which is the reconcile direction. The thread listing cannot, because
  it orders on activity and activity moves, so it pages on the pair
  (`last_active_at`, `id`) spelled out as two named parameters,
  `cursor_active` and `cursor_id`. Two values rather than one opaque
  blob is what keeps the rule: what a caller sends back is what it was
  answered with, and there is nothing here a later release has to go on
  decoding. The activity half has to carry a UTC offset, because the
  comparison is lexicographic on text: a naive spelling is shorter than
  every stored stamp and would page from the wrong place rather than
  from where it says.
- **A refused argument is never quoted back.** A limit, a cursor, a
  device or a day that cannot be read answers with a fixed sentence
  describing what the argument has to be, and so does a purge that
  named no selector at all. What arrived is the caller's, and a refusal
  that echoed it would be the one place this API prints something it
  was handed. The rule is not weaker on the erasures: a driver
  exception carries the statement it failed on and the connection
  string it failed over, so which sentence a failed deletion answers is
  decided by the db classifier's closed set and the exception is
  dropped rather than read.
- **A store with no rows answers its ordinary empty shapes.** There is
  no 404 for "this deployment never recorded" any more, and that is a
  deliberate contract change (#283): the distinction it drew was
  between a file that existed and one that did not, and there is no
  file. Boot migrates the schema whether or not recording is on, so
  what a deployment that never recorded has is empty tables, and an
  empty list is the honest answer to a question about them. The 404s
  that remain are the two about an id that was addressed.

Every read opens a connection for the length of one request through
`db.read_engine`: no migration, no advisory lock, and a repeatable-read
snapshot that cannot write. Every erasure opens a write engine for the
length of one transaction through `db.write_engine`, which takes the
chain's advisory lock at BEGIN and migrates nothing. Neither holds an
engine between requests, and both work with recording off, where there
is no `ConversationStore` and no engine to borrow.

That transaction reaches one row set this module does not own: a
thread's memory, its ledger and the facts it forgot, which shares its
thread's lifecycle. The deletes are the memory store's own SQL issued on
this transaction, so they commit with the turns or not at all, and the
counts this answers with are as true as the rest of them.

    The failure arms are the whole no-leak surface of a write, and they

    which sentence is answered is decided by the db classifier's closed

    Telling the writer happens in here, and where it happens is the
    ordering the dead-id rule needs, stated in three lines because three
    reviews have now circled this seam:

    - after the commit, never inside the transaction. A deletion that
      published and then rolled back would leave a thread that still
      exists marked dead for the rest of the process, so its later turns
      would be discarded with false acknowledgements while its rows sat
      there. A refusal has to leave the thread exactly as it was.
    - inside `store.erasure_order()`, which is entered before the
      transaction is opened and left after the publication. The commit
      releases the chain's advisory lock, and without this a writer could
      take that lock in the instant before the ids were published, find
      nothing, and write a turn onto the thread just deleted.
    - and the writer keeps the other side of the same order: it reads
      what was published inside its own durable transaction, on every
      attempt (`store._discard_dead`).

    The threads' memory goes inside the same transaction, before the
    commit and after the rows that name the threads have been read, so
    there is never an instant in which a conversation is gone while what
    it was keeping remains, and the two counts this answers with cannot
    be falsified by a later failure. The memory chain's lock is taken by
    the purge itself, second, which is the ascending order `db` states.
