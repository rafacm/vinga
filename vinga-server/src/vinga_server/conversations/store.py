"""The writer behind the conversation record: a queue, a thread, markers.

The sink is off the audio path, which is the whole of its contract. A
producer only ever `put_nowait`s, so the session loop never waits on the
store whether the database is locked, the disk is full or the writer is
dead; a background thread does every database call; and a stalled reply
is never an acceptable price for a record of it.

That contract shapes three decisions that would otherwise look
arbitrary:

- **The queue is unbounded and the bound lives on the droppable class.**
  `Event` records are what a wedged database backs up, and dropping them
  is the documented behavior, so they are refused at the producer beyond
  `MAX_EVENTS_IN_FLIGHT`. In flight means not yet written off: queued,
  or sitting in a per-session batch that no marker has committed. A
  count that stopped at the queue would bound nothing, since a session
  that never reaches a marker holds its events in memory while the
  producer sees a fresh allowance. `Open`, `Turn`, `Milestone` and
  `Close` are control records and are never refused: they are the
  store's structural truth, they arrive at conversational pace, and a
  dropped `Close` would leave the store unable to record its own
  incompleteness.
- **The writer commits at markers, into per-session batches.** One queue
  carries every session, so a marker commits exactly its own session's
  accumulated batch inside two short transactions, and the chain's
  advisory lock is not held across the interval between two turns. A
  page opened mid conversation reads everything up to the last completed
  turn.
- **Product state and telemetry never share a fate.** The two
  transactions are the durable half (the session row, the threads, the
  turns and their invocations, the recap checkpoints) and the lossy
  half (the event rows), in that order and with independent outcomes. A durable transaction that
  fails on the transient class the db classifier names is retried in
  place up to `TURN_WRITE_ATTEMPTS`; when it is finally dropped, the
  hole is latched on the thread as `conversations.incomplete` rather
  than counted and forgotten, and the mark rides the next durable
  transaction rather than one of its own, so no later acknowledgement
  can become true in front of it. An events transaction that fails drops
  and counts its events exactly as it always did, and touches no turn.
- **Absence of the session row is a tombstone.** Retention deletes whole
  sessions on `started_at` and asks nothing about whether the
  conversation ended, so a session long enough to fall outside the
  window can be taken while it is still talking. Every marker
  transaction therefore begins by confirming its session still exists,
  both halves separately, because they are separate transactions and a
  deletion fits between them. If it does not, the batch and the
  session's state are discarded and nothing further is written for it,
  which is what makes the deletion of a running session final rather
  than a race the next turn undoes.
- **A deleted thread has to be said out loud, because absence cannot say
  it.** A missing conversation row is two different things: a thread
  before its first turn, and a thread that has been erased. So the
  writer keeps the ids it has written a turn onto, a deletion publishes
  what it took through `erased()` below, and a turn for an id in both
  sets is discarded with its acknowledgement resolved false rather than
  materializing the row again. The conversation in the room carries on;
  its record stops, which is what erasure means.

Storage policy lives here rather than in the pipeline: the runtime hands
over the full record and the writer nulls the content columns when text
storage is off and the numeric columns when metrics storage is off,
skipping the events rows entirely in the second case. Nothing that
leaves this module carries row content, SQL or exception text: the
failure reports are built in the `except` arm out of the exception's
class name.

One thing is not policy and does not follow a switch. The `events`
table is metadata-only by construction, so `EVENT_CONTENT` is stripped
from every event's fields whatever the switches say: content has its own
tables, and an events row is the wrong place for it at any setting.

Half of that strip is now defense in depth and half of it is still live,
which is worth saying precisely. The narrowing took `text` off `heard`,
`replied` and `agent_said`, so those three keys never arrive; the strip
was written to be correct either way, which is what let the store behave
identically on both sides of that change and what meets a payload that
regains the key. It is a write-time rule and only that: it runs where a
row is built and no read applies it, so it says what lands in this
database and nothing about what an older one holds. `tool` still
arrives, on the one branch the narrowing kept it for: a builtin's name
is this application's own. The strip removes it from the row anyway, so
that every name a call carries lives in `tool_invocations` under the
text switch rather than in two tables under two different rules.

# The order the two halves of the dead-id rule are put in, above the
# database's own lock.
#
# The chain's advisory lock already serializes a deletion's transaction
# against a writer's, and for a while that looked like enough. It is not,
# because the deletion is two steps rather than one: the rows go in the
# transaction and the ids are published to the writer afterwards, and
# between the commit that releases the advisory lock and the publication
# there is an instant in which a writer can take the lock, find nothing
# published, and write a turn onto a thread that has just been deleted.
# This lock covers that instant. A deletion holds it across its
# transaction AND its publication; the writer holds it from before it
# opens a durable transaction until that transaction has the advisory
# lock and has read what was published. So the two are totally ordered:
# whichever went first, the second one sees all of it.
#
# The ordering rule that makes it safe is one sentence, and both sides
# keep it: this lock is taken OUTSIDE the chain's advisory lock, never
# inside. A holder of the advisory lock that then waited for this one
# would close a cycle with a holder of this one waiting for the advisory
# lock. Nothing else in this module takes it: retention and the events
# half take the advisory lock alone, which is a wait rather than a cycle
# because neither of them ever wants this.
#
# A process-level lock and not a per-store one, for the reason the
# register above gives: a deletion runs where no store object need
# exist at all.
#
# A deletion is no longer its only holder. An agent rename is the same
# shape of change: one transaction that moves rows a live writer is
# still addressing, and a publication afterwards telling this process
# what moved. Between its commit and its publication there is the same
# instant, and a writer slipping into it would land a turn under a name
# nothing answers to. So the rename holds this across its transaction
# and `renamed()` exactly as a deletion holds it across its own and
# `erased()`, and the property this lock is really about is the one both
# of them need: every store change a live writer must observe atomically
# is published under it. The name stayed the erasure's, because renaming
# a merged name is a change neither holder needs.
#
# There are two chains under it now, because a deletion also takes the
# memory of the threads it takes, and the order there is `db`'s:
# ascending by key, the record chain's before the memory chain's, so two
# transactions over the same pair can only queue. Both rules are one

    by taste. `CONVERSATIONS_CHAIN` is declared in this module and this

    a chain is a fact of the store that owns it. The statement reaches

    rename touches in the record. It is the one column here a live read
    filters on: the thread listing and the spoken-description search
    both select on it, and the thread guard refuses a turn whose agent
    does not match it. `turns.agent`, `sessions.agent`, `sessions.agents`
    and the agent names inside event fields are dated rows saying what

        Retried in place, and only for the db classifier's transient

        very likely commit if it were simply made again, and everything
        else is a database saying no for a reason a fourth attempt does
        not change. No sleep between attempts, because this thread is
        every other session's writer too.

        The marks a previous loss owes are written here too, after the
        turns and before the commit, which is what makes an
        acknowledgement safe to believe: the caller that wakes on one
        cannot find a thread with a known hole still claiming to be
        whole, because the mark and the turn became true at the same
        instant. It costs nothing when nothing is owed, and when the
        transaction is rolled back the ids stay owed and the turns stay
        lost together, which is the honest pair.

        A thread with no row yet is not marked and no row is made for
        it: an empty thread would be listed and offered as something to

        does with the mark already true (`threads.Landing.incomplete`).

        read and then overtaken: a deletion committing in the interval
        before this writer took the lock would be invisible, and the turn
        it should have discarded would materialize the row again. Read
        after BEGIN, the two are ordered by the lock they both take, and
        `_erasure_order` covers the one instant the advisory lock does
        not (the deletion's publication, which happens after its commit).
        Once per attempt, because a retry is a new transaction taking the
        lock again, and a deletion fits between two of them exactly as it
        fits before the first.

        writes by construction. Runs at start and at each session close,
        which is often enough for a store that only grows when a
        conversation happens.

        The ruleset is `threads.prune`, whose unit is the thread: a
        conversation older than the window goes whole, events go by
        their session's age, and a session row goes once no turn names
        it. What is decided here is only when to run it and what to say
        about it afterwards.

        What deletion means here is stated exactly, because the backend
        decides it and the backend has moved. A deleted row is invisible
        to every transaction that begins after this one commits,
        including the analyst role's; a repeatable-read transaction
        already in flight when it commits keeps seeing the row until it
        ends, which is what MVCC is. Reclaiming the space the row
        occupied is the database server's own storage maintenance
        (autovacuum), not a per-delete overwrite: there is no freed page
        for this process to write zeros over, and the file the SQLite
        era erased in place is not this deployment's to reach.

        A thread's memory goes in this same transaction, through the
        callable the composition handed over: a conversation's ledger and
        the facts it forgot share their thread's lifecycle, and a
        deletion that took the thread and then went for its memory would
        have a window in which the thread is gone and its state is not.
        The order the two chains' locks are taken in is the ascending one
        `db.advisory_key` states: this engine's begin listener takes the
        record chain's, and the purge takes the memory chain's.

        And what it took is published exactly the way an erasure through
        the API publishes: after the commit, inside `erasure_order()`, so
        a writer (this one included) cannot begin a marker between the
        commit and the publication and write a turn onto a thread
        retention has just taken. This runs on the writer thread, which
        is not inside a durable transaction here, so the lock is free to
        take.

        Failure is a dropped prune, not a dropped conversation: a store
        that could not delete still records, and the next close tries
