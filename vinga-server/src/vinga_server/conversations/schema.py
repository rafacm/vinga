"""The tables holding what was said, and what it cost to say it.

Its own `MetaData` and its own schema (`record`), beside the
domain configuration rather than inside it: the configuration is what an
operator writes and the server reads at boot, this is what the server
writes and an operator reads afterwards, and the two have different
retention, different privacy switches and different reasons to be
deleted. The split is also what the read-only analyst role is scoped to:
`vinga_ro` reads everything here and nothing next door, so a query over
what was said cannot reach a stored secret's ciphertext.

Typed columns carry identity, the references between rows and the
numbers a query filters on; JSON carries the structures the manifest and
the pydantic layers already own. Referential integrity is the writer's,
not the database's, for the reason `db/schema.py` gives: validation
belongs in one layer, and a constraint here would be a second place that
knows less about what a reference means.
The writer is not the only deleter either (retention takes whole
sessions, including one that is still talking), so what keeps its
inserts honest against a deletion is a check inside each of its
transactions, described in `store.py`, rather than a constraint here.

Every column carries a `comment=`. That is what
`docs/reference/conversations-schema.md` is rendered from, and the drift
test fails on a column without one, the same discipline
`Field(description=...)` enforces for the domain models.

The schema is called `record` and the thread table inside it is called
`conversations`, so SQL spells that table `record.conversations`. The
schema name says what the whole of it is, the durable record of what
was said and what it cost to say it, and the table name is one entity's:
a thread between a user and exactly one agent, spanning sessions. The
package, the config section, the events and the reference document all
keep `conversations`, because they name this store from outside, where
the entity is the thing a reader is after. A `turns` row names both the
session it was spoken in and the thread it belongs to, so the session
view and the thread view are two projections of one set of rows rather
than two stores, and no dialogue is written twice.

Two conventions run through the whole schema:

- **Timestamps are UTC ISO-8601 text and offsets are integer
  milliseconds**, the offsets aligned with the capture's `t_ms` because
  both derive from the session loop's clock reading at session open. A
  row and a capture triplet for the same session share one timeline.
- **Row ids are `bigint` identity columns.** A sequence never hands
  out a value it has already handed out, which is the property the three
  cursor tables need: retention deletes from exactly the end a cursor
  points past, and a reused id would hand a paginating client someone
  else's row under a cursor it had already consumed. `bigint` is what
  makes the API's `MAX_ROW_ID` true by declaration rather than by
  folklore about what a row id happens to be. `tool_invocations` is not
  a cursor table (it is read through its parent turn, never paginated on
  its own) and is declared the same way regardless, because a row still
  needs an id and one rule is cheaper to read than two.
