"""What the pipeline hands the store, one record per completed turn,
and the one shape that comes back the other way.

A dedicated content channel beside the event tap, rather than text read
back off the events: tool arguments and results never rode the events at
all, and the events are about to lose their `text` field, so a store fed
from them would be built twice and thrown away once.

Frozen, and imported by both sides while importing neither. The runtime
assembles these and the writer consumes them, which is the whole of the
contract between them; storage policy (which halves of a record the two
switches null) lives in the writer, so what arrives here is always the
full record.

Every duration is an integer millisecond count and every count is what
the provider reported, `None` where nothing was measured. `None` is
therefore "not measured", never "zero", which is the distinction a
latency query has to be able to make.
