"""The thread store: a conversation's life, as rows.

A conversation is a durable thread between a user and exactly one
agent, and this module owns what that means to the database. Its
callers are the queue writer, which embeds these operations in its own
marker transactions, and (as later milestones land) the API handlers
and the selection tools. What all three stop knowing:

- **The join topology.** A thread is `conversations` plus the `turns`
  that name it, the `tool_invocations` under those turns and the
  `conversation_milestones` on the thread itself. Nothing outside this
  module writes that shape or takes it apart.
- **When a thread becomes a row.** Not at activation: a wake that
  produced no transcript produces no turn, and an empty thread would
  clutter a listing and a spoken discovery for the sake of a
  conversation that never happened. The row lands with the thread's
  first turn, in the transaction that stores it, which is also what
  makes referential integrity the writer's in the one place the schema
  says it lives. And when it may not become one at all: a landing this
  module cannot attribute is refused, which fails the caller's
  transaction, because a stored turn with no thread is a row retention
  can never reach.
- **What a thread is called.** The earliest utterance stored on it,
  bounded. Content, and therefore under the text switch like the
  utterance it came from.
- **What a checkpoint replaces.** A recap is recorded with the turns it
  really read, and a thread that has one is read back as that
  checkpoint plus what was said after it. Both halves of that rule live
  here, so no caller can record a coverage the reads do not honour or
  read a thread as though its recap covered more than it did. The
  sources are checked in the transaction that would write the row,
  because a recap is spoken before it is stored and an erasure can
  commit in between.
- **The retention ruleset**, whose unit is the thread rather than the
  session, and whose ordering between the three rules is the whole of
  why a live thread never loses its turns to an old session.
- **What erasure reaches.** Deleting a session deletes its turns
  wherever their thread is, and in the same transaction everything
  those turns fed: the title derived from one, the recap checkpoints
  that summarized one and everything descended from those, the activity
  stamp one wrote, and the thread itself once it has nothing left. The
  automatic path and the on-demand one share these helpers rather than
  keeping two sets of bookkeeping, which is what the amendment to #190
  means by the purge being absorbed rather than rivaled.
- **That a lost write is a fact about a thread.** `flag_incomplete`
  writes the mark the writer latched, and answers which threads there
  was a row to mark, because a thread whose first turn was the lost
  batch has none yet.
- **That a database can refuse.** `Reads` is the door a reply in flight
  comes in through, and nothing raises out of it: a failed read is a
  fact the caller turns into a sentence, never a driver's own words on
  their way to a model.

No function here opens a transaction or an engine. Every one of them
takes the caller's connection and runs inside the caller's transaction,
which is what lets one marker commit a turn, its calls and its thread's
row together or not at all. `Reads` at the end is the deliberate
exception, and the exception proves the rule: its caller is a reply
being spoken, which holds no transaction and may not be given one.

Nothing here decides the storage switches either. The writer applies
them and hands over what survived, so a `heard` that arrived as None
under text-off produces a null title by the ordinary path rather than
by a second rule written here.

    Two shapes, and the distinction is the whole of the lifecycle: a
    thread this database has never seen materializes here, with its
    title derived and its two timestamps equal, and a thread it has
    seen has its activity moved. Both are decided by asking, rather
    than by an upsert, because the two do different things and only the
    first one has a title to derive.

    A materializing landing carries the writer's pending mark into the
    insert, so a thread whose earlier turns were lost says so from its
    first byte. A landing on a thread that already has a row never
    touches the mark in either direction: a later turn arriving does not
    fill an earlier gap, and `flag_incomplete`, which the writer calls
    beside this one in the same transaction, is what sets it.

    The title is the thread's earliest stored utterance rather than its
    earliest turn, which are the same thing everywhere except at the
    start of a thread a session moved onto: that thread's first turn is
    the answer the move was greeted with, and nothing was heard on it.
    So a row still holding no title takes one from the first landing
    that has an utterance to give it, and a row that has one keeps it
    whatever lands later. A deployment storing no text derives no title
    by the same rule, since no landing it makes carries one.

    A landing this module cannot attribute is refused rather than
    stored, and the refusal takes the marker's whole batch with it. Two
    shapes reach it: a session that understood no device, which has no
    provenance to write into a not-null column, and a turn whose thread
    already belongs to a different agent. Both are defects rather than
    configurations, because a session is closed before it records
    anything unless its device identified itself, the runtime activates
    an agent before it can produce a turn, and a thread id is minted per
    agent and never shared. Refusing is what keeps "every stored turn is

    The description and each candidate's text are normalized the same
    way (casefolded, punctuation replaced by a break, split on
    whitespace), a candidate's score is how many of the description's

    descending, then `last_active_at` descending, then id descending. So

    Nothing scoring is not a dead end: the newest `RESUME_CANDIDATES`

    because the session is old would take dialogue out of a thread
    somebody is still talking on. So turns die here with their thread
    and nowhere else, and what is left of an old session is the spine a
    surviving turn still points at.

    Three rules, applied in this order because each one's answer
    depends on the one before it:

    1. **A thread older than the cutoff goes whole**: its milestones,
       its turns' invocations, its turns, then its row. `last_active_at`
       is the age, so a thread that was spoken to yesterday survives
       whatever the age of the session that began it.
    2. **Events go by their session's age alone**, whether or not that
       session's row survives rule 3. They are session-scoped telemetry
       rather than part of the thread projection, so a live thread must
       not pin a year of decision track it has no reading of.
    3. **A session row older than the cutoff goes once nothing points
       at it.** Rule 1 has already run, so "nothing points at it" is
       decidable here: a session whose every turn died with its threads
       is free, and one still holding a live thread's turns keeps the
       minimal spine those turns cross-reference.

    Lexicographic comparison on UTC ISO-8601 text is chronological when
    both sides are written by `isoformat` at the same offset, which
    they are: the cutoff and every column here come from the writer's
    one clock.

    What rule 1 took is answered by name and not only counted, because

    is a UTC day and the comparison is strict, so a session that began
    at any moment of that day survives it: what an operator means by
    "before the fifteenth" is not "up to some time on the fifteenth".

    - every milestone whose recorded coverage holds one of those turns
