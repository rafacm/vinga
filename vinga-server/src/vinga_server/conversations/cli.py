"""The `vinga-server conversations` command group: schema and views.

Two commands, and neither needs a running server because neither opens
anything at all: `schema` prints the generated reference off the table
declarations, and `views` prints the one off the view declarations. Both
are documentation generation from what is declared in this package, and
neither is a read of stored data: querying the views live is the API and
CLI surface #440 owns. Nothing in this group reaches the conversation
store's file, which is the property that keeps the group whole once the
store is a database somewhere else (#281).

Every failure leaves as a `ConfigError` printed to stderr with exit code
1, naming the kind of failure without quoting the value that caused it,
and no traceback from argparse reaches the user.
