"""Turning a reply's sentences into audio, one ahead of the one being
spoken, and deciding which of them may be spoken at all.

The lookahead is a runtime concern by the litmus test: deciding when
speech synthesis may begin is not something that would exist if the
backend were a telephone call to a human. What it produces (PCM at the
voice's own rate) crosses the device-facing boundary; how far ahead it
runs, and what happens to a sentence nobody will hear, stays here.

The guard at the bottom is the other half of that last clause, and it
is here for the same reason: what may be said is a fact about the
sentence about to be spoken, and this is the module that owns sentences
on their way to a voice. `text.py` cuts them and stays ignorant of
tools; the tool loop asks this once per sentence and speaks whatever
comes back.

**The bound the guard states rather than closes.** A sentence is tested
whole, as it arrives, because a sentence has already been promised to
TTS by the time it exists: the splitter cuts at a newline, so a
pretty-printed call arrives as a handful of fragments no decoder can
read, and each of them speaks. Closing that would mean holding
sentences across newlines, which is where the model's own formatting
says one thing ended, so the residue is left visible through the event
instead.

**What the splitter does hold, and what bounds it.** A compact call is
one line and reaches here whole, which it did not always: the
punctuation rule cut `{"a":"Milk. And eggs"}` at the `. ` inside the
argument into two fragments that were each ordinary text, and both
were spoken (#391). `text.py` now stands the punctuation rule down
while a brace is open, counting braces outside JSON strings, which is
the smallest rule that keeps a compact object in one piece for this to
read. It is bounded three ways, because a sentence held there is a
sentence not yet being synthesized: a newline cuts whatever is open,
`flush` releases everything at the end of the stream, and
`MAX_HELD_FOR_A_BRACE` caps the span, so an unmatched `{` in prose or
a quotation mark that opens a string nothing closes costs a bounded
delay rather than the rest of the reply.

**And the cost of the argument-only prong.** Matching an object's key
set against a tool's declared properties withholds a JSON example whose
keys happen to mirror an offered tool, which an agent asked to explain
one would say out loud. That is the trade the narrower rule cannot
make: the shape actually observed in the field carries no name at all
(`{"volume":"100"}`), so a guard that insisted on one would not catch
the thing it exists for. The event makes each withholding visible, and
a deployment for which the trade is wrong changes the model rather than
the guard.

class _Synthesis:
    """One sentence being turned into audio, started before the moment it
    is needed.

    A reply is spoken sentence by sentence, and frames are paced to
    realtime, so sending a sentence takes about as long as hearing it.
    Synthesizing only when the previous sentence has finished playing
    therefore puts the next sentence's whole time to first byte on the
    speaker as silence, once per sentence, for the whole reply. Measured
    on a three-sentence reply: 617 ms and 520 ms between sentences
    through `gpt-4o-mini-tts`, reported from a board session as "hiccups
    in the assistant's voice". Starting the work early spends that time
    against playback that is already happening (#37).

    A task pulls from the provider into a one-chunk buffer. `chunks()`
    yields what has arrived and waits for the rest, so a sentence run
    ahead has already paid its time to first byte by the time anyone
    asks for it, while the first sentence of a reply still streams:
    nothing is held back waiting for a sentence to finish.

    The buffer holds one chunk, not the sentence. Playback consumes at
    realtime and a provider can produce much faster than that, so an
    unbounded buffer would hold a whole sentence of PCM per sentence run
    ahead and remove the backpressure the paced consumer used to apply
    to the provider. One chunk is all the lookahead needs, because what
    it exists to absorb is the wait for the *first* chunk.

    A failure is held rather than raised where it happened, and re-raised
    from `chunks()` at the point the sentence would have been spoken.
    That keeps the order of what a caller sees: the sentences before a
    failing one are spoken, and the reply fails where it would have.

    The first chunk is reported the same way a failure is, and for the
    same reason: this is where the request is made and where the answer
    arrives, so it is the only place the wait between them exists. What
    the caller does with it is the caller's; nothing here is timed for
    the device, which has its own `speaking_started` for that.
