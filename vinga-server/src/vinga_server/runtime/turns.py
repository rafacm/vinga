"""One turn's record, assembled while the reply that produces it runs.

The sibling of [`turntaking.py`](turntaking.py), and the two are told
apart by what they are about: this module records what a turn
contained, `turntaking.py` decides who is speaking.

The pipeline holds the whole of a turn in hand exactly once, at the end
of the reply: the transcript and its language fields, what each agent
said, every call the model issued and what became of it, and the numbers
no event carries on its own (the summed token counts, the ASR elapsed,
the reply's first audio). Correlating that back out of the events later
would mean re-deriving it from JSON on every query, which is fragile
against exactly the field evolution the store exists to survive. So it
is accumulated here as it happens and handed over once.

Two things live here rather than in `pipeline.py`. The accumulator, so
that a reply path already busy with audio does not also carry a dozen
running totals; and the tool classifier, because "where did this name
come from" is asked twice (by the record now, by the narrowed
`tool_call` event later) and one answer is the point.

Nothing here talks to a store: it builds `conversations.records` values,
which is a leaf module both sides import and neither owns.

class TurnUnderway:
    """The turn being assembled, one reply long.

    Mutable and deliberately dumb: every field is written by the reply
    path at the moment it learns the value, and `record` is the one read.
    A reply that was cancelled or failed hands over what this holds when
    its `finally` runs, exactly as `replied` reports what was spoken.

    `None` means not measured throughout, never zero. A round that never
    finished contributes nothing, so `rounds`, `llm_ms` and the token
    sums always describe the same set of rounds: the ones that produced
    an `llm_round` event.

    The three leading fields are the exception to "written by the reply
    path": they are taken where the turn begins and never written
    again. The first two are the pair that owns the turn. A handover changes who is speaking
    partway through, and a record is assembled after that has happened,
    so a turn that read the current pair then would be attributed to the
    thread it handed over to. Held here rather than passed to `record`
    because the reply path is where it would have to be remembered, and
    remembering it in half a dozen places is the mistake this removes.
    Neither of the two is optional, because the store materializes a
    thread row out of exactly them and refuses a turn it cannot
    attribute.

    One reply produces one of these per conversation it was spoken on,
    which for almost every reply is one. A move ends the turn it was
    asked in and opens the next on the other side, so what an instance
    holds is never a blend of two threads: the pair above is fixed, and
    the totals under it are that pair's share of the reply and nothing
    else.

    `utterance` is the third of the fixed fields and the one that
    SURVIVES that move, which is the whole of why it is here. The pair
    identifies the thread this share of the reply was spoken on and
    differs between the two instances a handover makes; the utterance
    identifies what the user said to prompt all of it, and is the same
    on both. It is what a reader holding one stored row uses to find the
    trace the turn went out under, since the exporter opens one turn
    span per utterance and knows it by this name.
