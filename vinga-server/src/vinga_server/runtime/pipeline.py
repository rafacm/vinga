"""The bespoke conversation runtime: VAD, ASR, an LLM tool loop, and TTS.

One utterance at a time, run behind the device-facing boundary. It talks
as one agent at a time, the active agent, picked at connect from the
agents the device is bound to; prompt, providers, and endpointer all come
from that agent, so swapping it swaps all three.

While the device listens, decoded mic audio feeds the agent's
endpointer; when the utterance ends, ASR transcribes it, the LLM streams
a reply into sentences, and TTS speaks each sentence back through the
device. Conversation history lives here, one list of turns per
connection.

The reply is a tool loop, and the loop lives here rather than in a
provider because only the runtime can change agents between rounds. Per
reply it snapshots the tools the active agent may use, streams, executes
whatever the model asked for, feeds the results back, and streams again,
up to a small cap whose last round forbids calling so a reply always
ends in speech. History stays text-only: the structured tool turns exist
in a working copy inside one reply, and what survives is what was
actually said aloud.

An utterance that ends while a reply is streaming cancels that reply and
is answered, which is what barge-in is. An endpointer-driven cancel is
gated: a reply is only cancelled on evidence of user speech (enough
classified speech, a transcript when in doubt), because acoustics alone
are as often noise or the reply's own bleed as the user (#28). A manual
`listen stop` mid-reply is a deliberate act and cancels unconditionally.

What happens in a conversation is logged twice over: as a human
sentence, and as the structured fields the JSON log format emits as
top-level keys. Both halves go out through the session's
`SessionEvents` ([events](../events/__init__.py)), so that every record carries
the same channel and the same identity whichever side of the boundary
emitted it, and so that every consumer of the events sees it.

    no codec. Built by `bespoke_runtime_factory` below, which is what
    the composition root hands the device edge.

    Two of the things it used to do are now modules of their own. Who
    holds the floor is `TurnTaking` ([turntaking.py](turntaking.py)),
    which reaches back through `ReplyControl`, a Protocol this class
    satisfies structurally; the latency mask is `FillerRunner`
    ([filler_runner.py](filler_runner.py)), which reads the floor
    through `TurnView` and never writes it. What stays here is the
    orchestration: the reply task, the conversation history, the tool
    loop, agent handover, and the provider observability.

    The mutable state that crosses those responsibilities, listed
    because it is what a reader has to hold in mind at once (#141):

    - `_reply_task`: created by `start_reply`, read by `replying` and
      `drain`, cleared by `cancel_reply`. The turn-taking side and the
      device edge both ask about the reply in flight, and both ask
      through those methods, so the field itself keeps one owner.
    - `_providers` and `_know_how`: written by `_activate_agent` alone,
      at connect and at a handover, and read by every leg of the reply
      that follows, `confirm_transcript` included.
    - `_asr_language`: written where the reply's own ASR answers, read
      by that call and by the confirmation the gate ladder asks for, so
      the session's language lock survives an interruption.
    - `_turn`: the record being assembled, replaced at the start of each
      reply, written from half a dozen places in the loop, and read once
      at the end by `_record_turn`.
    - `_turns`: the conversation history, appended by the reply path and
      by each agent leg, read wherever a round is built.
    - `_llm_round`: reset per reply, counted up per round, read by the
      watchdog's retry line and by `llm_round`, which is what makes the
      generation after a handover a round of its own.
    - `_agent`: a property over `self._events.agent` rather than a field,
      because both sides of the boundary attribute events to whoever is
      talking, so the events object is the one place it can live.

        streams only a tool call (a handover does) would look exactly
        like a stalled request and be cancelled at the timeout while
        healthily delivering. The announcement is consumed here, being
        evidence rather than content, so nothing downstream sees it.

        One timeout cancels the request and retries the round once,
        since the field data says the retry answers quickly (6.16 s
        total against the 17 s stall it replaced). A second timeout
        gives up: the failure is reported as the provider's, with
        `FirstTokenTimeout` telling it apart from the provider's own
        classes, and the reply ends the way any provider failure ends
        it, so the failure mode is a silent turn rather than a wedged
        session. Barge-in keeps working through the whole window: it
        cancels the reply task, and that cancellation lands in the wait
        here like in any other await.

        The provider's own timeout classes pass through untouched: the
        `expired()` check is what keeps an SDK timeout raised just
        before the watchdog's deadline from being retried as if the

        Stage latency was otherwise inferred from the gaps between

        holds the LLM and the TTS time to first byte with nothing
        between them. A field session lost 19.04 s inside that gap
        against a session median of 1.18 s, and the logs could not say
        whether the payload or the vendor was responsible (#55).

        `turns` is the cheap proxy for payload size, and `round` counts
        the whole reply rather than one agent's leg, so the generation
        after a handover is a round of its own rather than another
        first round. Token counts appear when the provider reported
        them; their absence is a fact about the endpoint. They are named

        it. A timeout is worded as one, because where traffic is
        dropped rather than refused the whole symptom is a wait.

        Which failure is a wait is a question of type. Every provider
        raises `ProviderCallTimeout` for its SDK's timeouts and that is
        a `TimeoutError`, as are `asyncio.TimeoutError` and the
        watchdog's own `FirstTokenTimeout`, so one `isinstance` covers
        the lot (#137). It used to be decided by looking for "Timeout"
        in the class name, because the SDKs' own classes agreed on
        nothing: `openai.APITimeoutError` is an `APIConnectionError` and
        `httpx.TimeoutException` inherits from neither.

        The class name is reported and the exception's message is not.
        The five real providers raise the request-time taxonomy, whose
        messages carry trusted metadata only (`providers/kit.py`), but
        this takes a `BaseException` from four call sites and one of
        them is the LLM stream, so anything an SDK or a transport
        raises can arrive here unwrapped, and an exception raised near
        a response body can embed one in its message. That would land
        in the sentence, in the record's arguments, and from there in

        once at connect, and again mid-reply when switch_agent hands the
        conversation over. The history carries across the switch: it is
        text-only, so nothing provider-specific leaks with it, and the
        new agent seeing what was said is what makes "switch to the
        tutor and explain what we just discussed" work.

        This is also where the know-how half of the system prompt is

        what the registry's slice holds, so a reload that landed since

        chose: an agent that merely exists is not one this device may
        talk to. Nothing is swapped when the name is refused, so the
        session keeps the agent it already had.

        Which world the prompt is read out of is the one decision here
        that is not obvious (#191). The current one, because that is
        what an activation converges at and the whole reason a reload
        reaches a conversation at all; the session's own when the
        current one has never heard of this agent, which is exactly the
        state an apply that deleted it leaves behind. This device is
        still bound to it and this conversation is still allowed to hand

    to and the world to build all of that from, and never learns what an

    the reload built.

    `mcp_servers` is closed over rather than read off the world, and

    registry is one object whose contents an apply replaces, so an
    utterance is answered with the tools that are running rather than
    with the ones that were running when the conversation began.

    `conversations` is closed over, and is the reason the recorder
    reaches a runtime without the `RuntimeFactory` type moving: the

    means no store, which is every deployment that has not asked for one.
