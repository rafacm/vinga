"""The bespoke conversation runtime: VAD, ASR, an LLM tool loop, and TTS.

One utterance at a time, run behind the device-facing boundary. It talks
as one agent at a time, the active agent, picked at connect from the
agents the device is bound to; prompt, providers, and endpointer all come
from that agent, so swapping it swaps all three.

While the device listens, decoded mic audio feeds the agent's
endpointer; when the utterance ends, ASR transcribes it, the LLM streams
a reply into sentences, and TTS speaks each sentence back through the
device. Conversation history lives here, one list of turns per
connection.

The reply is a tool loop, and the loop lives here rather than in a
provider because only the runtime can change agents between rounds. Per
reply it snapshots the tools the active agent may use, streams, executes
whatever the model asked for, feeds the results back, and streams again,
up to a small cap whose last round forbids calling so a reply always
ends in speech. History stays text-only: the structured tool turns exist
in a working copy inside one reply, and what survives is what was
actually said aloud.

A sentence of that reply is spoken unless it is shaped like a call to
one of the tools the same snapshot offered, which is a model writing
its own calls into its speech rather than an answer (#385). Such a
sentence is dropped whole, reported as its own event, and enters
nothing: not the leg, not the history, not the record. A reply that
ends having spoken none of its sentences and withheld some says the
agent's fixed fallback phrase, because what the user is otherwise
handed is exactly the silence that phrase exists to end.

An utterance that ends while a reply is streaming cancels that reply and
is answered, which is what barge-in is. An endpointer-driven cancel is
gated: a reply is only cancelled on evidence of user speech (enough
classified speech, a transcript when in doubt), because acoustics alone
are as often noise or the reply's own bleed as the user (#28). A manual
`listen stop` mid-reply is a deliberate act and cancels unconditionally.

What happens in a conversation is logged twice over: as a human
sentence, and as the structured fields the JSON log format emits as
top-level keys. Both halves go out through the session's
`SessionEvents` ([events](../events/__init__.py)), so that every record carries
the same channel and the same identity whichever side of the boundary
emitted it, and so that every consumer of the events sees it.

    what this runtime knows about the far end: no socket, no protocol,
    no codec. Built by `bespoke_runtime_factory` below, which is what
    the composition root hands the device edge.

    Two of the things it used to do are now modules of their own. Who
    holds the floor is `TurnTaking` ([turntaking.py](turntaking.py)),
    which reaches back into four of this class's methods and nothing
    else; this world's cached speech is `FillerRunner`

    two questions and never writes it. What stays here is the
    orchestration: the reply task, the conversation history, the tool
    loop, agent handover, and the provider observability.

    The runner owns two verbs and this class uses both: the reply path
    arms the latency mask at the transcription and settles it at the
    end, and two arms ask it to say the agent's fixed phrase, the one
    that catches a terminal failure and the check at the end of a reply
    that spoke nothing because every sentence of it was withheld.
    Saying the phrase adds nothing here: what it needs is a read of the
    world's cache and the output handle, both of which are the runner's
    already, so a failed turn speaks without this class learning
    anything new to remember (#384). Deciding whether the second arm
    fires does, and it is the pair of reply-wide facts below, because
    the question is about the whole reply and nothing the runner holds
    can see one (#385).

    The mutable state that crosses those responsibilities, listed
    because it is what a reader has to hold in mind at once (#141):

    - `_reply_task`: created by `start_reply`, read by `replying` and
      `drain`, cleared by `cancel_reply`. The turn-taking side and the
      device edge both ask about the reply in flight, and both ask
      through those methods, so the field itself keeps one owner.
    - `_providers` and `_know_how`: written by `_activate_agent` alone,
      at connect and at a handover, and read by every leg of the reply
      that follows, `confirm_transcript` included. That one reads it
      before an await a handover can land in, and answers with the ear
      it read, for the reason `Confirmation` gives.
    - `_asr_language`: written where the reply's own ASR answers, read
      by that call and by the confirmation the gate ladder asks for, so
      the session's language lock survives an interruption.
    - `_turn`: the record being assembled, replaced at the start of each
      reply and again at each move the reply makes, written from half a
      dozen places in the loop, and read by `_record_turn` at the end of
      whichever conversation it belongs to. The pair it is stamped with
      at replacement is the pair the turn is attributed to.
    - `_conversations`: one thread per agent this session has activated,
      written by `_activate_agent` alone and read through
      `self._conversation`, which is a property over the events object
      for the reason `_agent` is.
    - `_histories`: one conversation history per thread, appended by the
      reply path and by each agent leg, read wherever a round is built,
      and reached through `_turns`, which answers with the history of
      the thread the active agent is on.
    - `_resumption`: this session's offered-candidate state and its way
      into the store, absent where the deployment did not ask for
      resumption, which is what makes both conversation tools answer a
      spoken refusal instead of moving anything.
    - `_acknowledged`: the store's handle for the last turn recorded on
      each thread, written where a turn is handed over and read only by
      a resume about to rebuild that thread. Never waited on anywhere
      else, which is what keeps the recording path non-blocking.
    - `_llm_round`: reset per reply, counted up per round, read by the
      watchdog's retry line and by `llm_round`, which is what makes the
      generation after a handover a round of its own.
    - `_remembering`: whether the agent speaking may reach memory,
      written by `_tool_loop` alone where it takes the tool snapshot and
      read through `_remembering_now` by the builtin source's offer and
      dispatch and by `_system_prompt`. A field rather than an argument
      because those two readers are on two clocks, and one field is what
      makes them one answer.
    - `_reply_spoke` and `_reply_withheld`: whether any sentence of the
      reply now ending went out, and whether any was dropped as a leaked
      tool call. Reset and read by `_speak_reply`, which owns the
      question the pair answers: the two together are what says a reply
      is about to hand the user silence it never meant to. Fields rather
      than locals because they outlive what a leg holds: `spoken` is
      cleared at every leg boundary, so a reply that spoke through one
      agent and was wholly withheld on the next would read as empty from
      it, and the withholding itself happens a call away, inside the
      tool loop.
    - `_agent`: a property over `self._events.agent` rather than a field,
      because both sides of the boundary attribute events to whoever is
      talking, so the events object is the one place it can live.

        Nothing used to bound the gap between sending the request and
        the first byte of the answer, so a provider that stalled there
        froze the pipeline: a 17 s stall held the session in replying,
        deaf to a user who politely waits, until a barge-in rescued it
        (#68). The bound covers only that gap. Once anything has
        arrived the stream is streaming and no timeout applies, because
        a long generation that is delivering is healthy: a 17.7 s story
        round with a 635 ms first token is fine.

        "First token" is the stream's first event of any kind. The
        adapters announce their first raw chunk off the wire as a
        `StreamStarted`, because both buffer tool-call fragments until
        the stream has ended: without the announcement a round that
        streams only a tool call (a handover does) would look exactly
        like a stalled request and be cancelled at the timeout while
        healthily delivering. The announcement is consumed here, being
        evidence rather than content, so nothing downstream sees it.

        One timeout cancels the request and retries the round once,
        since the field data says the retry answers quickly (6.16 s
        total against the 17 s stall it replaced). A second timeout
        gives up: the failure is reported as the provider's, with
        `FirstTokenTimeout` telling it apart from the provider's own
        classes, and the reply ends the way any provider failure ends
        it, so the failure mode is a silent turn rather than a wedged
        session. Barge-in keeps working through the whole window: it
        cancels the reply task, and that cancellation lands in the wait
        here like in any other await.

        The provider's own timeout classes pass through untouched: the
        `expired()` check is what keeps an SDK timeout raised just
        before the watchdog's deadline from being retried as if the

        Stage latency was otherwise inferred from the gaps between
        events, and the gap between `heard` and `speaking_started`
        holds the LLM and the TTS time to first byte with nothing
        between them. A field session lost 19.04 s inside that gap
        against a session median of 1.18 s, and the logs could not say
        whether the payload or the vendor was responsible (#55).

        `turns` is the cheap proxy for payload size, and `round` counts
        the whole reply rather than one agent's leg, so the generation
        after a handover is a round of its own rather than another
        first round. Token counts appear when the provider reported

        dropped rather than refused the whole symptom is a wait.

        Which failure is a wait is a question of type. Every provider
        raises `ProviderCallTimeout` for its SDK's timeouts and that is
        a `TimeoutError`, as are `asyncio.TimeoutError` and the
        watchdog's own `FirstTokenTimeout`, so one `isinstance` covers
        the lot (#137). It used to be decided by looking for "Timeout"
        in the class name, because the SDKs' own classes agreed on
        nothing: `openai.APITimeoutError` is an `APIConnectionError` and
        `httpx.TimeoutException` inherits from neither.

        The class name is reported and the exception's message is not.
        The five real providers raise the request-time taxonomy, whose
        messages carry trusted metadata only (`providers/kit.py`), but

        raises can arrive here unwrapped, and an exception raised near
        a response body can embed one in its message. That would land
        in the sentence, in the record's arguments, and from there in

        once at connect, and again mid-reply when switch_agent hands the
        conversation over.

        The history does not carry across the switch, and that is the
        behavior #190 changed here: a conversation is a thread between a
        user and exactly one agent, so binding the incoming agent to its
        own thread is also binding it to its own history. What it starts
        with is the seed the transition writes; what it comes back to on
        a second handover is what it said the first time. Agents are
        scoped on purpose, and a switch that handed the whole session
        over would leak around that scoping and would move words spoken
        to a local agent to whatever provider the incoming one runs on.

        This is also where the know-how half of the system prompt is
        assembled, which is the whole of when it happens: at session
        open and again at an agent switch, and never per reply. Nothing
        is fetched here, because nothing needs to be: the persona is
        configuration this server is already holding and the guidance is
        what the registry's slice holds, so a reload that landed since
        is picked up by the next session or the next switch rather than
        by a conversation in flight.

        The device's bound list is enforced here rather than left to
        callers, because the next caller is a tool whose argument a model
        chose: an agent that merely exists is not one this device may
        talk to. Nothing is swapped when the name is refused, so the
        session keeps the agent it already had.

        Which world the prompt is read out of is the one decision here
        that is not obvious (#191), and it is `_world_of`'s: the current

        Both halves of the condition matter. A reply that spoke nothing
        and withheld nothing is an empty answer from the model, which
        this has never had anything to say about; a reply that withheld
        a sentence and spoke the rest is the issue's own constraint,
        that one bad sentence does not discard a good answer.

        Here, at the end of the reply, rather than by raising from the
        loop. The failure arm's log line means a reply that broke, and a
        reply whose model wrote its calls into its speech did not break:
        it is a fact about the model this deployment configured, and the
        record the runner emits says exactly that.

        Reached with nothing active, which the failure arm has to nest a
        block to arrange and this gets for free: it is a statement in
        the ordinary flow of a reply, so a cancellation landing in the
        notice leaves with an empty chain behind it rather than carrying
        whatever was being handled.

        The settle is the failure arm's, for its two reasons and one
        more of this site's own. A clip still sounding must not be
        talked over and the shared encoder must not be interleaved; and
        a reply that spoke nothing never sent a batch, so the tail wait
        inside `_send_reply_audio` was never reached and this is the
        first thing in the turn that would have waited for the mask at
        all. The wait re-raises a cancellation of this reply rather than
        swallowing it, so a barge-in confirmed while it runs takes the
        turn instead of the notice; the `finally` in `_reply` settles
        again, idempotently, and still owns the closing `tts stop`.

        successful one ends the loop rather than producing a result the
        model reads.

        The exception is the calls `names.ORDERED_TOOL_NAMES` names,
        which run first and one at a time, in the order the model issued
        them. Every one of them writes a memory, and two writes in one
        round decide each other: by the identity the model gave them, a
        ledger key or a fact's number, or by the prune a scope at its cap
        runs on every write. What is true afterwards is whichever ran
        last, so run concurrently the answer would be decided by which
        transaction reached the chain's lock first rather than by what
        the model asked for, and a set followed by a clear could leave
        the set.

        Before the rest rather than beside them, which costs a round
        trip nothing was waiting on and buys the simplest cancellation
        story there is: a barge-in during one of these leaves no
        dispatch running that nobody is awaiting.

        `slots` says where on the turn's record each of these calls was
        already reserved, index for index with `calls`, which is why
        both halves are split out of one enumeration rather than
        rebuilt: a move the model asked for third keeps the third call's
        place, whatever order this method runs things in.

        The moves are resolved in the order the model issued them, and
        that IS the precedence when it asks for more than one: the first
        wins and the rest are refused, whether they were the same kind
        of move or not. A rule about which kind outranks which would be
        a rule nobody could predict from the outside."""

    """The composition root's half of the seam: everything this runtime
    needs that outlives one connection, closed over once at startup.

    The device edge calls what comes back with a device to speak
    through, the session's observability, the agents the device is bound
    to and the world to build all of that from, and never learns what an
    LLM is.

    Neither the engines nor the clips are closed over, and that is the
    one thing here worth reading twice. Both belong to a world rather
    than to a process, so both are read off the generation the edge
    hands in, which is the generation the edge is telling the registry
    this conversation holds (#191). What that decides is where a change
    converges: a conversation goes on speaking through the engines and
    masking with the clips it opened on, and the next session gets what
    the reload built.

    `mcp_servers` is closed over rather than read off the world, and
    that difference is the tool half's own convergence point: the
    registry is one object whose contents an apply replaces, so an
    utterance is answered with the tools that are running rather than
    with the ones that were running when the conversation began.

    `conversations` is closed over, and is the reason the recorder
    reaches a runtime without the `RuntimeFactory` type moving: the
    store outlives every connection, and the per-session channel is
    derived here from the identity the edge already hands over. None
    means no store, which is every deployment that has not asked for one.

    `threads` is the other direction through the same database, and it
    is closed over for the same reason and holds nothing per session:
    reading a stored thread is a connection opened for the read and
    disposed after it. Whether a conversation may actually be resumed is
    not decided here but in the runtime, off the section it already
    holds, so the switch and the keys it reads live in one place.

    The session-close purge is passed only where `conversations` is
    None, and that condition is the whole of the decision. Where threads
    are recorded, a session's close is not a thread's end: the thread can
    be resumed, so its ledger and the undo it is holding outlive the
    connection, and what takes them is the erasure or the retention pass
    that takes the thread. Where nothing is recorded, no thread row ever
    lands, no retention runs and no closed session's thread can ever be
    resumed, so the session's close IS the thread's end and the runtime
    takes its own threads' memory as it tears down. That is what keeps a
    long-running recording-off process bounded without waiting for a
    reboot.

    Deliberately one function rather than a config-selectable registry:
    one runtime exists, and a selection mechanism with one option is
    surface without a reader. This is the seam a second runtime plugs
    into."""
