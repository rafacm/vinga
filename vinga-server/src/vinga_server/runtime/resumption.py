"""Finding an earlier conversation, and picking it up again.

The flow between a model asking for a past thread and the runtime moving
onto one. Three things live here because they are one decision spread
over two utterances, and splitting them would put half of it in the tool
layer and half in the reply path:

- **What was offered.** A tool result exists only inside one reply's
  working list, so a model asked to "resume the second one" an utterance
  later has nothing to resolve it against but its own recollection. The
  offer is therefore kept here, per agent, and an id is honored only
  when this agent was offered it: an invented id, a stale one from
  before a newer search, and one offered to a different agent in the
  same session are all the same refusal.
- **What a thread becomes.** The store's rows, under the deployment's
  budget, through the hydrator. This module is where the two meet, so
  neither the tool nor the reply path has to know that a budget exists.
- **What a failure says.** Every read goes through the sanitized seam
  and is bounded here, so a slow database is a tool that answered a
  sentence rather than a reply that stalled. The sentences are the
  tools' own closed vocabulary, imported rather than restated.

- **What a long thread was offered.** A backlog wider than the budget
  is not swapped in; the user is asked whether to hear a recap of the
  whole of it or carry on from the recent part, and the one
  conversation awaiting that answer is kept here per agent, beside the
  offered ids and cleared by the same rules. A `start_from` for
  anything else is a recap nobody was asked about.
- **What a recap is made of.** The same rows under a budget of their
  own, plus the range they really covered and the ids inside it, which
  is what a checkpoint is allowed to claim and what the store checks
  that claim against when it finally writes one.

What is deliberately NOT here: minting an id, rebinding an agent to a
thread, installing a history, waiting for this session's own last write
to a thread before reading it back, speaking a recap and storing one.
The first four are the device session's conversations'
([session_conversations.py](../session_conversations.py)), which own
the transitions and the write handles; the runtime applies them at the
turn boundary only the reply path can see, and speaks and stores the
recap, because that is the reply.
