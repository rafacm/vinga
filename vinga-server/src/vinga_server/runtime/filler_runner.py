"""This session's cached speech: the latency mask it plays when a reply
is late, and the phrase it says when one fails.

The sibling of [`filler.py`](../filler.py), and the two are told apart
by when they run: that module builds both kinds of clip once at boot,
synthesizing each agent's phrases in its own voice and caching them as
PCM, while this one is the per-session runner that decides whether a
cached clip goes out at all. Nothing here synthesizes anything, and
nothing there knows a session exists.

One class for both, because they are one act with two triggers: taking
a clip from this world's cache, resampling it, encoding it in one batch
and sending it down the device's paced path. Everything that act needs
(the output handle, the read-only clip views, the batching rule that
keeps the shared encoder honest) is held here once, and a second owner
of paced clip playback would be a second copy of the rule the risk
section of #74 exists about.

They differ in what triggers them and in what they are. The silence
between the end of an utterance and the first audio of a reply is where
a voice assistant feels dead (#48), and a filled pause is how a human
holds that gap: a timer armed at the transcription, and a clip if the
reply has not started speaking by the time it expires. That is a noise
that buys time, so it announces nothing and stays out of the transcript.
The failure phrase is asked for rather than timed, by the reply body's
own failure arm, and it carries information the user needs, so it goes
to the display as well as the speaker (#384). It is still not something
the model said, and it enters no transcript either.

The mask yields to whoever holds the floor, which is read as two
questions and answered with nothing. A user still speaking, or a
barge-in being confirmed, stands the timer down, because a mask that
talks over the user is worse than no mask at all. The failure phrase
asks no such question: it is said after the reply is over, when nobody
is holding anything.

    `fillers` is the clip cache keyed by agent, read off the generation
    this session bound and never asked for again: a reload that
    re-synthesizes a clip reaches the next session rather than this
    conversation, which is what keeps the masking a turn was armed under
    from changing under it. Empty means no agent masks its latency, and
    a plain dictionary is as much a cache as the mapping a generation
    carries, so a test that hands it two entries need not build a world.
    `agents` is what the device is bound to, which is what the arming
    rule asks rather than only the agent talking now.

    `fallbacks` is the other cache off the same generation, read the
    same way and bound at the same instant: what a failed reply says is
    the phrase this conversation opened with, whatever a reload has
    synthesized since. It defaults to empty, which is honest for every
    caller that is not about failure phrases and is what a world built
    before anything was synthesized holds.

    `conversations` are the device session's, and what this runner
    reads there is who is talking: the clip caches are keyed by agent,
    and every record it writes names the agent and the thread. Read at
    each site rather than taken once, because this runner is a task of
    its own and a handover can land in any of its awaits; handed in
    beside the events object rather than read off it, because the events
    object only says things and the conversations are where the pair
    lives.

    `turn` is whoever is deciding the floor, and the fire-time
    stand-down asks it two things: how much of what was fed the
    endpointer classified as speech (`speech_ms`), and whether the
    outgoing frames are being held for a barge-in confirmation
    (`output_paused`). Two reads and nothing else. The mask yields to
    the user, so nothing about the floor is this runner's to change, and

        paced recipe below that a clip has to go out through. The reply
        body asks; nothing about playing a cached clip moves.

        The phrase goes to the display as well as the speaker, which is
        the one place this differs from the filler above and the
        difference is deliberate. A filled pause is a noise that buys
        time and sends no `sentence_start` anywhere. This carries
        information the user needs, and `sentence_started` is the only
        display the protocol has. It is still not something the model
        said, so nothing here touches the reply's spoken sentences, the
        conversation history or the stored turn: what says it happened
        is the record below.

        `reason` is why the turn had nothing else to say, and it is the
        caller's because only the caller knows: the failure arm has an
        exception in hand, and the empty-reply check has a reply that
        finished having spoken nothing. What it chooses is the sentence
        the record renders, and nothing else here; both reasons say the
        same phrase the same way, which is the point of there being one
        phrase.

        Nothing at all where the agent has no phrase, which is an agent
        whose section is off and a world built before anything was
        synthesized alike: an entry that is present is one to say, which
        is the same rule the clip lookup above follows. A phrase whose
        synthesis failed is present without audio, and the turn is shown
        and not heard.

        The contract is the fire path's, exactly: `CancelledError`
        propagates, because swallowing one would consume a barge-in or
        an abort and the reply's own `finally` sends the closing
        `tts stop` either way; a device that went away is swallowed,
        since there is nobody left to tell; anything else is a bug in
        this process, reported by class name and swallowed, because a
        broken notice must not cost the turn the `tts stop` that re-arms
        a device's listening.

        What the record says is what happened, which is why it is
        written after rather than before. A cache holding a clip is not
        a clip that went out: the display send can fail, the encode can
        raise, the device can vanish, and a barge-in can take the turn
        between the two. So the two deliveries are tracked as they
        happen and the record is written from what they answered: none
        at all where nothing was delivered, and `audio` saying whether
        the phrase was heard as well as seen. Written in a `finally`, so
        a cancellation that lands after the display send still leaves
        the fact that the user saw it.
