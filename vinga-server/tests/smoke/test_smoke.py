"""The M7 acceptance, run against whatever server is up.

Four things, in the order a device meets them: the server is alive, the
OTA endpoint hands out a real websocket URL and a real token, that token
is one this deployment's secret signed, and a whole conversation runs
from audio in to spoken audio out.

The device here is xiaozhi-sdk, the same simulator the integration lane
uses, so it performs the token round trip exactly as firmware does:
persist what OTA gave it, send it as a bearer token on the handshake.
