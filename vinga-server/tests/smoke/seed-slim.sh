# The domain half of the slim image's boot check: every network stage on
# an external provider, which is what the slim variant exists for. This
# configuration loads no local engine, so it has to come up in an image
# that carries none.
#
# The keys are throwaway and nothing here talks to a vendor: what this
# proves is that the server builds its providers and serves both
# endpoints, not that a conversation runs. The seeding server this writes
# through needs none of them: with an empty domain half there is no
# provider to build. What it does need is what a server needs,
# VINGA_AUTH_SECRET and VINGA_API_SECRET. The conversation is the
# mock-provider smoke suite's job, and it runs against both variants.
#
# silero is the exception and stays a local engine deliberately: it is a
# core dependency rather than an optional extra, so it is present in
# both variants and runs on every audio frame whichever ASR is
# configured.
