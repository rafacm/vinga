# Run from the image itself before the container starts, so the seeding
# exercises the shipped artifact rather than a checkout, and against the

# It starts a server of its own to write through, so the container it
# runs in needs what a server needs: VINGA_AUTH_SECRET, and
# VINGA_API_SECRET for the API the CLI writes to.

# The order is the one the write-time reference checks require:
# providers, then the agent defaults, then the agent, then the binding
# that names it.
