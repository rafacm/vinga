# The server a seeding script writes through, started and stopped by it.
#
# `vinga-server config` writes through the configuration API, so seeding
# a database means having a server to write to. Each seeding script
# starts one of its own inside the seeding container, against the same
# data volume the real container will read, configures it over loopback
# with the image's own CLI, and stops it again. The volume then holds the
# seeded database, and the seeding has exercised the shipped artifact
# including its API rather than a fixture.
#
# Starting on an empty domain half is a valid boot: the rule that every
# stage of every agent resolves is checked only when agents exist, so a
# fresh database serves no agents and is otherwise a running server.
#
# Sourced rather than copied into each script, because process lifecycle
# is exactly where three near-identical copies drift apart.
#
# The server needs the environment a server needs: VINGA_AUTH_SECRET and
# VINGA_API_SECRET. It needs no provider credential, because with an
# empty domain half there is no provider to build.

# The port to reach the server on, overridable so that a test run and a
# CI container can each pick a free one. Exported rather than only read,
# so that the server binds it, the CLI resolves it (an environment
# override beats the mounted file) and the poll below waits on it: three
# readers, one value, no drift between the file's port and this one.

# And where the CLI sends the writes, set rather than left to be
# resolved. The CLI gives an inherited VINGA_API_URL precedence over
# the port, which is right for an operator and wrong here: an ambient
# one, left over in a shell or set in a CI job for another deployment,
# would take the seeding writes and the bearer token with them while
# the server started below stayed empty. The seeding writes to the
# server the seeding started, and to nothing else.
