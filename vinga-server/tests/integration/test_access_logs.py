"""What a deployment's own log holds about the requests it served.

Two of this server's request lines are things nothing may print. The
OTA endpoint's path carries the deployment's secret segment, which is
the only credential a stock board can present, and an activation code
arrives in the path of a claim, rejected value and all. An access log
prints request lines, so this asserts there is no access log: the
server is run through the same uvicorn configuration `serve()` builds,
at INFO, with real requests carrying both sentinels, and neither
reaches either of the two shipped formats.

Run here rather than in the unit lane because the thing under test is
what uvicorn writes, which needs uvicorn to have served something.
