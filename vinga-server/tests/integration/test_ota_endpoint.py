"""The OTA endpoint against a live server over real HTTP.

The unit lane drives the app in-process. This one starts uvicorn on a
loopback port and speaks to it the way the device does, which is what
catches anything the ASGI test client papers over: the config the CLI
loaded reaching the handler, and the websocket URL being derived from the
address the device actually connected to.
