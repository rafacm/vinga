"""Device authentication and the connection cap, against a live server.

The unit lane drives the gate in-process, where the ASGI test client
reports a pre-accept close as a disconnect. Here a real client speaks
real HTTP to real uvicorn, which is the only place the thing that
actually matters is visible: a refused handshake is answered 403 on the
upgrade, so no websocket is ever established.

The rest of this lane now runs with auth on and xiaozhi-sdk forwarding
the token the OTA endpoint issued it, so the accepted path is covered
by every other test here.
