"""What the default install carries, and what it must not.

The whole of this milestone's claim, proven in an environment rather
than asserted about one. Five doors lead into this package and each is
exercised here:

- the **client** door, which is `uvx --from git+...` on a laptop: the
  project installed with no extras at all, which must carry the
  configuration grammar and must carry none of the server. It must also
  carry the half of `doctor` a laptop uses, which is diagnosing a URL
  it was given; deriving one is the server's half and refuses;
- the **server** door, which is the image build: the same project with
  `[serve]`, which must boot;
- the **simulator** door, which is a person trying vinga with no
  hardware: the same project with `[sim]`, which must be exactly the
  client closure plus one distribution and must ANSWER the gated verb
  rather than refuse it. That is the other half of the gate the client
  door proves closed, and it is the only place `simulator run` is driven
  from an installed tier;
- the **telemetry** door, which is a deployment that wants traces: the
  same project with `[otel]`, which must be exactly the client closure
  plus what the two OpenTelemetry distributions drag in, and must carry
  none of the server. Its other half is the plain `[serve]`
  environment, which deliberately does NOT get the extra: that is the
  one place in this repository where the packages are genuinely absent,
  so it is where a server asked for telemetry is asked for the real
  missing-extra refusal rather than a faked one;
- the **contributor** door, which is `cd vinga-server && uv sync`: the
  project with its default groups, which must yield a runnable server
  with no new flags. It is the one door a mistake in is invisible to
  every other lane, because every other lane names its tier explicitly,
  and this file is the guard the plan names for it.

**The proof is a closure, not three named probes.** A negative check
that reaches for `fastapi`, `sqlalchemy` and `cryptography` by name
passes the day somebody adds a fourth heavy dependency. So the expected
sets are derived from `pyproject.toml`'s own tiers, and the assertion is
over the whole installed distribution set: every client dependency
present, every serve-only distribution absent, and every serve-only
top-level module unimportable.

**Every command is run, not imported.** Importing `cli` from a client
install proves nothing about a command whose heavy import sits inside
its own arm, which is exactly what `openapi`, `ota-url` and `check`
are. So the grammar's own inventory is split in two here, the gated
commands against everything else, and both sides are invoked as
subprocesses of the installed binary. The `vinga-server` entry point's own gated
sibling, the conversations group, is driven here too: it is outside the
grammar's tree, so nothing about `cli.COMMANDS` would ever reach it.
M3 widens that to the full registered inventory
against a live server; what is here is the tier, and a command that
moved between the two sets fails from whichever side it left.

**The closure is computed, not enumerated.** The expected set for each
tier is the recursive walk of `uv.lock` from that tier's roots, extras
and markers included, and the installed set is compared to it exactly
in both directions. A subset check would pass a transitive distribution
nobody declared, which is the shape a heavy dependency comes back in.
The six direct client names stay beside it as an independent oracle
read from `pyproject.toml`, so the lock is checked against something
that did not come from the lock.

The environments are built once for the whole module and reused, and
they are built with `uv sync --frozen` rather than `uv pip install`
because only the first installs what the lock says: the second
re-resolves from the index, and an environment built that way cannot be
compared exactly to a graph it did not come from.
