"""The configuration API over a real socket, and across a restart.

The unit suite drives the same routes through an injected test client,
which is the right seam for the acceptance suite and cannot show two
things. One is that an answer arrives at all rather than being cut short
by the client's own timeouts, which only a real connection and a real
lock can demonstrate. The other is the API-era first start, which is not
one request but a sequence of them across two server lifetimes: start on
an empty database, configure over HTTP, restart, and serve what was
configured.
