"""Tools end to end: the milestone's acceptance and the cases around it.

The device is xiaozhi-sdk, the pipeline is the mock providers, and the
MCP server is a real one spawned over stdio, so the whole path (LLM
asks, server routes, tool answers, LLM speaks the answer) runs without
a key, a model, or a network. The mock LLM's tool calling is scripted,
which is what makes a conversation about tools deterministic.
