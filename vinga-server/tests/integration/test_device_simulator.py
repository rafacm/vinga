"""The xiaozhi-sdk device simulator against a live server.

This is the plan's M4 acceptance: the sdk discovers the websocket URL
through the OTA endpoint, completes the hello exchange, speaks an
utterance, and gets a coherent spoken reply from the conversation
pipeline running on the mock providers (an `stt` transcript, a
sentence with the reply text, and the spoken audio). Since the sdk
encodes and decodes with opuslib, the run also cross-validates the
server's PyAV codec against an independent one.
