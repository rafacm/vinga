"""`vinga simulator run --claim`, from an unclaimed board to a spoken
reply, against a real server.

The CLI lanes next door share one live server, and that server is right
for what they ask: it boots fileless on an empty database, so no agent is
servable and every board is unbound. A conversation needs the opposite,
which is why this lane is its own file: the app here is built from a
`Config` with mock providers in it, the way `test_device_simulator.py`
builds one, and served on a thread so the synchronous CLI can talk to it.

**It starts in `Activating` deliberately.** There is no default agent, so
the first check-in offers a code and hands back an empty token, and the
run traverses all four steps of the ceremony: check in and read a code,
claim through the act the grammar already has, poll where a waiting board
polls, and check in AGAIN. The fourth step is the one that makes the
other three worth anything, because the poll route answers a status and
the only thing that mints a token is a check-in reply. A case that
started from an already servable agent would pass with that step missing,
which is why the starting state is part of the assertion and why the case
below removes the step and watches the handshake fail.

**One case starts from the opposite deployment on purpose.** Device
authentication off with a default agent set is what #369 was reported
from: the board is admitted at its first check-in and handed an empty
token, because there is no credential to hand it, and the reply is
otherwise byte for byte the one a board nobody will admit receives. That
case gets its own server, since every other case here needs
authentication on to have any bite at all.
