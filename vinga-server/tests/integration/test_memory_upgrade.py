"""The memory chain's forward migration, proved on rows rather than on
an empty database.

`tests/unit/test_memory_schema.py` asks what the chain builds from
nothing: the head, the columns, the indexes, the checks, and that the
tables and the migrations agree. Every one of those passes on a
database that lost every row, which is exactly the failure a rename can
produce: autogenerate sees `agent` dropped and `owner` added, and a
migration written from that candidate would carry the shape across and
nothing else.

So this seeds a database at `2001_agent_memory`, the revision a
deployment upgrading into this release is stamped at, with rows whose
ids, moments and text this file knows exactly, brings it to head the
way a boot does, and reads them back. What is asserted is what the
promise is worth: the bytes, the scope every existing row turns out to
have had, the held pair standing null, and identity continuing past the
seeded maximum rather than restarting on an id that already names a
fact.

The lane, rather than the unit suite, because the material is a
database in a state no current build produces and the fixture that
makes one is `blank_database`: a migrated template cannot be stamped
backwards.
