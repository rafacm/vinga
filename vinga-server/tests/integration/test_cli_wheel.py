"""The grammar as an INSTALLED ARTIFACT, driven against a live server.

Every other lane runs the CLI as code this repository imports. The
source tree makes every module importable whether it was packaged or
not, and `cli.main(argv)` is a function call rather than a program, so
nothing before this file has ever asked whether the thing an operator
installs works: whether the wheel carries what it needs, whether the
default install resolves, whether the `vinga` binary exists and answers,
and whether a command that needs the server half says so rather than
ending in an ImportError.

So this builds the wheel, installs it BARE into a clean environment, and
drives the actual binary as a subprocess against a real server. The
server stays in this process, in the same `serving()` thread the
in-process lane uses, because that is the cheap way to have a server and
not because it preserves anything.

**This lane is beside the in-process one, not instead of it.**
`test_cli_live.py` is the SECURITY lane: it runs client and server in
one process so `Watched` can read every log record, every unformatted
argument, every extra attribute and every exception chain, which is
where the refusal leaks live and where this issue's new sentences are
proven not to leak. A child process makes all four of those surfaces
invisible, and capturing its stdout and stderr is not the same
assertion. So this lane asserts on exit codes, stdout and stderr, and
makes no no-leak claim it cannot support.

**The wheel's own closure is checked here, and only here.** The tier
lane holds an environment to what `uv.lock` says the DECLARATION
resolves to. Nothing in it reads the built artifact, so a wheel whose
`Requires-Dist` said something else would install a heavier closure
while both lanes stayed green: the metadata a resolver actually consults
is the wheel's, not the lock's. So this lane reads `Requires-Dist`
straight out of the built file and holds it to the declared tiers in
both directions, and then asserts the serve half is absent from the
environment that file was installed into, as distributions and as
importable modules.

Metadata plus absence, rather than a resolver report compared against
the installed set. A report would be a second re-resolution, which is
the thing this lane deliberately does not do (it installs one file), and
comparing one would re-derive the tier lane's claim under a different
name. What the two assertions here close between them is the gap the
review named: the artifact cannot ask for anything the declaration does
not, and what it asked for is what arrived.

**`uv pip install <wheel>` here, and `uv sync --frozen` there.** The
tier closure lane builds its environments with `uv sync --frozen`, and
argues in its own head that `uv pip install` re-resolves from the index
so an environment built that way cannot be held exactly to a graph it
did not come from. That is right, and it is right for that lane's
question, which is what the DECLARATION resolves to. This lane's
question is a different one: what the built ARTIFACT carries, which
means installing that file and nothing else, and `uv sync` would install
the project from the source tree rather than the wheel. So the two lanes
install differently on purpose, and each asserts only what its own
installation can support. Nothing here says anything about the closure;
the closure is the other lane's, and a distribution set compared to
`uv.lock` is not compared here at all.

**Provenance is proven, not presumed.** The commands run in a temporary
directory outside the checkout with `PYTHONPATH` and its relatives
scrubbed, the resolved package file is asserted to sit inside the clean
environment before any command runs, and the installed distribution is
asserted to record the wheel this lane built as where it came from.

**Coverage is the full registered inventory, both ways.** Every row of
`cli.COMMANDS` is RUN, never merely imported: importing `cli` proves
nothing about a command whose heavy import sits inside its own arm,
which is exactly what the gated pair is. The ungated rows are driven
against the server and asserted to answer; the gated ones are driven and
asserted to print the fixed sentence and exit 1. Which row a command
line names is `tests.support.config_cli.registered`, the same matcher
the in-process lane and the spelling census read, so a command that
moved between the two sets fails this lane from whichever side it left.

The fragments and the document the session writes are this lane's own,
written into the run directory rather than read from `examples/`, so no
command here can reach the checkout by a relative path. That the wheel
carries the example fragments is proven the other way, by the recipes
region of the reference rendering non-empty from the installed artifact.

Ordering: the tests below share one wheel, one environment and one
server on purpose, because what they describe is one operator's session
against one deployment. They run in the order they are written, which is
pytest's order within a module and, under `-n auto --dist loadfile`,
still one worker's order. The completeness test is last for that reason
and skips rather than lies when the module was not run whole.
