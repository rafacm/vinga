"""Shared machinery for the integration lane.

Every test here runs a real server on an ephemeral port and talks to it
with xiaozhi-sdk as the device, on mock providers, so the lane needs no
keys, no models, and no network. The pieces two or more test modules
need live here as fixtures rather than being imported across modules.

A test writes the configuration it is about as a `Config`, and the
server it gets is booted the way a deployment boots: the domain half is
written into a scratch database through the repository, read back, and
composed onto the file half again. So every scenario in this lane also
covers the round trip through the database, and a test says what it is
about rather than how the configuration is stored.
