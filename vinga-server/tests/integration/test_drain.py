"""The shutdown drain against a live server.

The unit lane drives the registry with fake sessions. This one holds a
real conversation over a real socket and drains mid-reply, which is the
only way to see the thing the drain exists for: the sentence the device
is speaking reaches its end, and only then does the socket close.
