"""The domain chain's forward migration, proved on a row rather than on
an empty database.

`tests/unit/test_db_open.py` asks what the chain builds from nothing:
the head, the tables, the columns. Every one of those passes on a
database whose rows the migration mangled, and this one's whole subject
is a row: `3002_drop_max_tokens_secrets` deletes exactly the provider
secret slots named `max_tokens` and must leave every sibling slot of the
same row where it was.

The slot could be stored because the option heuristic called
`max_tokens` secret-shaped and the slot check read the same predicate
(#277). Nothing ever consumed such a row, but a deployment holding one
would boot it, list it as stored-secret metadata, and render it into an
export's foot as a `provider secret set ... max_tokens` command that
the post-change import path refuses, which is the export-and-reapply
recovery breaking on a deployment that asked for none of this. So the
release deletes the slot, and this is where that is worth what it
claims: the four surfaces an operator meets it on are read after the
upgrade, and the sibling credential is read back as its own plaintext.

The lane, rather than the unit suite, because the material is a
database in a state no current build produces and the fixture that makes
one is `blank_database`: a migrated template cannot be stamped
backwards.
