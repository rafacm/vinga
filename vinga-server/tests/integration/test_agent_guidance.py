"""An MCP entry's guidance reaches the agents granted it, end to end.

The issue's verification steps for the first deliverable, run against a
real server on a real port with a real device on a real websocket, and a
real MCP server spawned over stdio. What makes any of it visible from
outside is the mock LLM's `{system}` placeholder: a session's prompt is
otherwise invisible from the far end, so the reply is the prompt, spoken
back.

Four properties carry the file. Guidance follows the grant, so two
agents granted one entry both speak it and an `mcp: []` agent speaks
none of it. What a server ships about itself follows the opt-in, so two
entries backed by the same server differ by exactly that. A shared
fragment follows the include, so one block of text written in one place
reaches every agent that names it, and an edit of it reaches them at
the restart the write said it would. And the two halves of the prompt
keep their two clocks, which the held session proves in the only place
it can be proved: inside one conversation, across a reload, a reconnect
and an agent switch.
