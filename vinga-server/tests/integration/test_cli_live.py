"""The whole `vinga-server config` grammar, driven over a real socket.

The unit lane's acceptance spine (`tests/unit/test_config_cli.py` and its
five neighbours) runs the same entry point against the same application,
with one thing replaced: `cli.build_client` hands back a `TestClient`
instead of opening a connection. That is the right seam for those suites
and it is exactly what this one may not do. Here `build_client` is
untouched, so every command that reaches a server resolves an address,
applies the transport policy, opens a socket, sends a bearer token a real
ASGI server checks, and reads an answer a real uvicorn wrote.

Four of the grammar's commands reach nothing at all by design (`schema`,
`reference`, `openapi`, `ota-url`). They run in this lane too, in the
same environment as the rest, and what is asserted about them is the
opposite claim: that an environment naming a running server and a
database directory leaves them opening neither. `check` is the fifth of
that family and only half of it: it reaches no server either, and it
does open the database, so what is asserted about it is that it agrees
with the server already booted on that store.

What that buys, and what nothing in-process can show:

- The addressing and the transport policy run in front of the seam, so
  the acceptance suites drive them and stop. Here they are what finds the
  server.
- A refusal is composed by the API, serialized, sent, parsed by the CLI
  and printed. That the sentence survives the round trip intact is a
  claim about the wire, and this is where it is made.
- `import` has no read timeout at all (`cli.IMPORT_READ_TIMEOUT_S`), which
  a mock transport cannot demonstrate: there is nothing to wait for.
  Both halves of the bound are proven here against a server that really
  takes time to answer.

The lane's server is booted the way decision 9 asks the quick start to
be: from environment variables alone, with NO configuration file
anywhere. `test_the_lane_s_server_booted_from_the_environment_alone`
states that as a claim rather than leaving it a property of a fixture.

Coverage is derived rather than declared. `run` records the row of
`cli.COMMANDS` each command line names, and only when the command
succeeded, so what the recording holds is "this command completed" and
not "this command line was typed". The last test in the file holds that
recording to the registration table, which is what makes a command added
to the table and not to this lane a failing test rather than an omission
nobody sees.

Ordering: the tests below share one server and one store on purpose,
because what they describe is one operator's session against one
deployment. They run in the order they are written, which is pytest's
order within a module and, under `-n auto --dist loadfile`, still one
worker's order. The completeness test is last for the same reason, and
skips rather than lies when the module was not run whole.

    """The stream, opened against the real server by the real command,
    while a real board talks to it.

    This is the one case that can prove the half M1 wired through the
    session edge. A server event reaches the hub through the
    process-global tap, which any test can drive; a SESSION event
    reaches it only because the hub is attached to `SessionEvents` as
    the session is constructed, and only a conversation over a socket
    against a booted server produces one. What the line printed here
    carries is `session=`, which is exactly the field a server event
    does not have.

    **The tail is a process of its own, and it has to be.** Every
    request boundary in this repository holds the request loggers quiet
    under one process-global lock, for the span from raising a level to
    putting it back (`logs.quieted`). A tail's span is the length of the
    stream, so an in-process tail holds that lock while it watches, and
    the conversation this case drives goes through the same boundary:
    the two would deadlock, with the tail waiting for an event the
    conversation could not produce. On a deployment the question does
    not arise, since a tail IS a process doing one thing. Here it means
    `subprocess`, which also gives the case a deadline it cannot outlive
    and a kill it cannot skip, so a regression makes this lane red
    rather than hung.

    The check-in happens BEFORE the stream opens, deliberately. It is
    what mints the token this conversation presents, and it emits an
    `ota_check` of its own; with the tail already open that event would
    be the first one admitted, and this case would be proving the tap it
    is not about. What runs while the stream is open is the socket and
    nothing else.

    The conversation is driven in a loop because nothing here can
    observe the moment the subscription attaches, and a stream that
    opened a millisecond after the only event would otherwise wait for a
    second one that never came.

    """The recovery procedure, end to end over a real socket.

    Seed a deployment and store a credential on it, keep the export,
    stop the server, drop and recreate the database, rotate to a key the
    old one is not in, boot another server on the empty one, import the
    export, re-run the secret set command the export annotated, and
    start the server once more. Then read the credential back, and
    export.

    The drop and recreate is the documented reset run rather than
    described: `dropdb` then `createdb`, which is exactly what the
    helper below does.

    A new key rather than the old one, because that is the case the
    deployment notes promise: the key is lost with the database it
    opened, and what the next boot needs is a key list that opens every
    envelope stored, which after a rebuild is only the ones just
    written. Carrying the old key across would prove a weaker thing than
    the documentation claims.

    The last two steps are what make this a proof rather than a
    round trip. Starting the server again runs the boot's exhaustive
    verification against the new key, so ciphertext nothing can open
    fails here. And the credential is read back as plaintext before the
    exports are compared, because an export carries a credential's
    location and the command that fills it and never its value: a
    a secret set that stored the wrong bytes writes an export that matches
    the first one to the letter.

    A store and a key of its own, because the deployment is destroyed
