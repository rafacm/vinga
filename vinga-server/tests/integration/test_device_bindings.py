"""Binding a device on a running server, over the API it serves.

The unit lane writes through the repository, which is the seam the
acceptance suites use and cannot show the thing this milestone promises
an operator: that the command they type reaches the server they are
talking to, and the board on the desk is served by the same process a
moment later. Here the write is an HTTP request to the mounted /api, the
check-in is an HTTP request the firmware makes, and the conversation is
the device simulator, all against one uvicorn on a loopback port.

    Every repository write holds the domain chain's advisory lock for

    operator's write would stall the fleet's check-ins and every connect
    behind them. It cannot: a reader takes no advisory lock and reads
    its own snapshot, which is what MVCC gives it.

    handshake, the utterance and the spoken reply, plus a lookup on the
