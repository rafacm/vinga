"""The conversation store against a real server and a real device.

The unit lane drives the same wiring through a test client. What only
this lane can say is that a whole deployment records: a server booted
the way a deployment boots, a device that is xiaozhi-sdk over a real
socket, two utterances on one connection, a tool the device itself
serves, and a file on disk afterwards holding the session, its turns,
the calls under them and the decision track beside them.

The tool matters here rather than in the unit lane: a device tool is the
one source whose name and arguments come off the wire from the peer, and
its invocation row is what the text switch governs.
