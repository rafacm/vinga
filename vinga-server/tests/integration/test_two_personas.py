"""Two devices, two personas, one server: the plan's M5 acceptance.

One server run, one config: MAC A is bound to the `poet`, MAC B to the
`tutor`, and the two agents share their LLM, ASR, and VAD through
`agent_defaults` while differing in prompt and voice. Two xiaozhi-sdk
simulators hold their conversations concurrently, and each is checked
for both halves of its persona: the reply text quotes that agent's own
prompt (the mock LLM speaks back the system prompt it was handed), and
the received audio's dominant frequency is that agent's own mock voice.

A third device, bound to nothing, gets `default_agent`; against a
config with no agents at all, a device is turned away with 1008.
