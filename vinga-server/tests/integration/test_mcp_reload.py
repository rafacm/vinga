"""A written and granted MCP server becomes reachable without a restart.

The issue's first verification step, executed end to end: a real server
on a real port, a real device on a real websocket, the writes and the
reload over the real configuration API, and a real MCP server spawned
over stdio in between.

One socket and one session across the whole sequence, which is the whole
point. The promise is per-reply pickup inside a running conversation,
and the lane's `converse` helper opens, speaks once and closes, so a
test built on it would pass by reconnecting: it would prove that a
restart is not needed and say nothing about the session. So this one
holds the connection open across both utterances and asserts the session
never changed.
