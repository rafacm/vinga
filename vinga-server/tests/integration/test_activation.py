"""The whole ceremony, over HTTP, against one running server.

The firmware's activation loop simulated as the loop actually runs
(`Application::CheckNewVersion` in 78/xiaozhi-esp32): check
configuration, be handed a code, poll /activate in bursts three seconds
apart, and re-check configuration each time round. Here the operator's
claim lands in the middle of that, and the same process hands the board
a token seconds later and then holds a conversation with it, all through
the short URL an operator typed into a captive portal.

The unit lane drives the same states through a test client. What only
this lane can show is that they are one server: the code minted by the
device-facing endpoint is the code the API's listing shows and the API's
claim retires, on one process, over real sockets.
