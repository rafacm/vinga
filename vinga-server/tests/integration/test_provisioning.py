r"""What `deploy/postgres-init.sql` really provisions.

The file is the one home of the read-only analyst role, and nothing in
the server executes it: the compose service mounts it into
`/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` and an infra repository runs the same
bytes by hand. That is exactly the shape of thing that stops being true
without anybody noticing, so this lane executes the committed file and
asserts its whole contract rather than reading it.

Four claims, and each of them is a way the role could be wrong:

- `vinga_ro` reads every table of the conversation record, so an
  analyst asking what was said gets an answer, and every named
  aggregate view over it, so the questions those views exist to answer
  are answerable by the role they were built for.
- It inherits `SELECT` on a table created after provisioning ran, so
  the next migration does not silently take the record away from them.
- It has neither `USAGE` on the domain schema nor any write anywhere,
  so a query over conversations cannot reach a stored secret's
  ciphertext or change anything.
- It has no `USAGE` on the memory schema either. Remembered facts are
  not more sensitive than the transcripts it already reads; the
  operator read surface for them is #83's design, and granting the raw
  tables early would freeze a contract #83 reshapes.

And one claim about the file rather than the role, which is the reason
the file is rerun rather than merely present: a release that adds a
schema is met by an existing least-privilege deployment as a boot that
cannot create it, and the documented order (rerun administratively,
then deploy) is what carries it across with every row intact.

Against a database of this test's own rather than the lane's: the file
creates schemas and grants, which is not a state the next test should
inherit, and `vinga_ro` itself is instance-level and survives whatever
happens to a database, which is precisely the fact that makes the file
repeatable and worth asserting.

`psql` is a real prerequisite here and the lane refuses without it,
rather than skipping. The file is written in psql's own language
(`\getenv`, `\gexec`), which is what lets one file serve compose and an
infra repository unchanged, so running it through anything else would
be testing a translation of it. The runner has the client; a
contributor who has a Postgres to point this lane at almost always
does too.
