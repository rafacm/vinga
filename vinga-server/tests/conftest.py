"""What every lane needs before it can build a server.

Device authentication is on by default, and an enabled auth with no
secret in the environment is a boot failure, so a lane that builds an
app needs a secret. Setting one here rather than turning auth off keeps
every lane running the way a real deployment does: real tokens issued
by the OTA endpoint and checked at the websocket handshake.

An already-exported secret wins, which is what lets the smoke lane point
at a container and sign with the secret that container was started with.

Set at import time rather than in a fixture: a test module that builds
the app while it is being imported (the boot test does) needs the
secret before collection, not before the first test runs.

The bytecode setting below is here for the same reason: it has to be in
place before pytest imports the first test module.

# source's current values. So any edit that keeps the byte count and
# leaves the mtime on the second it was compiled on is invisible. Two
# ordinary operations here do exactly that:
#
#   - Checking a regression test really fails without its fix. Reverting
#     usually swaps two statements, which preserves the byte count, and
#     a scripted revert-run-restore finishes inside one second.
#   - Restoring a file from a backup, which carries the backup's mtime
#     rather than the current time, landing back on the compiled second.
#
# The result is a tree that lies about what it is running. It cost half
# an hour on #13, where a restored fix ran as its pre-fix version.
#
# Writing no bytecode removes the cache, and with it the stale cache. It
# covers pytest's assertion-rewritten test bytecode too, which uses the

# constantly. Measured cost is noise: the expensive imports live in

# vinga-server` or a bare `python -c "import vinga_server..."`, and
# every tree that predates this file has a full set. So clear them, once
# per process, before the first import of anything under test.
#
# Once per process and not once per run, because under xdist this file
# is executed by the controller and by every worker, each of them a
# process of its own. Two of them clearing while a third imports is
# safe by mechanism rather than by luck: CPython's import machinery
# falls back to compiling from source when reading a cached `.pyc`
# raises `OSError`, so a half-deleted cache costs a recompile and can
# never produce a wrong import.
#
# This also covers the one file the flag cannot: pytest writes a
# conftest's rewritten bytecode *before* it executes the body that sets
# the flag, so by now this run has already cached this file. Clearing
# leaves the next run nothing stale to read.

# That leaves one residual, which cannot be closed from inside the file
# that would have to close it: a run whose *own* conftest cache was
# already stale on entry reads it before reaching this line. It is one
# run wide and self-healing, because from here on no run ever ends with
# a conftest cache on disk to go stale. Closing it properly would mean
# clearing before pytest starts, which means a wrapper everyone has to

# --- the database this lane runs against --------------------------------
#
# Both lanes need a real Postgres, and the shape of how they get one is
# a performance decision as much as an isolation one. A fresh migrated
# database per test would be correct and would cost a `CREATE DATABASE`
# and two Alembic chains per test, which is seconds each; a shared one
# would be fast and would leak every test's rows into the next. So the
# lane takes the middle: one database per worker process, migrated once,
# with a `TRUNCATE ... RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE` between tests. That
# statement is milliseconds and leaves exactly what a fresh database
# has, so a test still opens on empty tables and identity columns still
# start at 1.
#
# The stamps survive it by construction rather than by an exclusion
# list: the tables truncated are enumerated from the three `schema.py`
# metadata objects, and none of them carries an `alembic_version`
# table. Truncating those would leave the next opener rerunning a
# baseline against schemas that already have its tables.
#
# Three things make this safe to point at a developer's own machine:
#
#   - Every database this lane makes carries a per-run prefix, generated
#     once by the controller and inherited by the workers, so two pytest
#     runs on one instance never collide and a run's leftovers are
#     identifiable.
#   - `VINGA_DB_URL` is cleared and `VINGA_DB_NAME` is overridden for
#     this process, so nothing exported around the lane can redirect the
#     fixtures onto a database they did not make.
#   - Every destructive statement checks its target first: a `TRUNCATE`
#     asks `current_database()` and refuses unless it is this worker's
#     own generated name, and a `DROP DATABASE` refuses any name outside
#     this run's prefix.
#
# The family splits in two, and the split is the whole of what went
# wrong once. Four of the variables name the INSTANCE, and an exported
# value wins: that is how CI points the lane at its service container
# rather than at a loopback default. The fifth names a DATABASE, and
# this lane makes its own, so an exported value must lose. It did not:
# `VINGA_DB_NAME` was never set here at all, only the model default was
# moved, and the loader reads the environment over the model default
# (`config/loader.py`'s `_with_database_environment`). CI exports
# `VINGA_DB_NAME: vinga`, so every code path that composed its settings
# through the loader (the CLI's own, and every application built the way
# a deployment builds one) worked in the job's shared `vinga` database
# while the truncation cleared a per-worker database nothing was
# writing to. Four workers then wrote over each other and the suite read
# rows from tests it had never run.
#
# The lane refuses rather than skips when the instance is unreachable. A
# skip would shrink the suite silently and read green while proving
# nothing about the half of this server that stores things.

# --- the lane guard -----------------------------------------------------
#
# A refused emission is dropped after one report on the emitter's own
# channel (#239), which is the right answer in production and a terrible
# one in a lane: a malformed emission would cost a green suite nothing
# at all and be discovered in a deployment's logs. So the lanes read
# that report as a failure. This, and not a mode the emitters run in, is
# what keeps them loud.
#
# The handler is installed ONCE, from `pytest_configure`, and that is
# the whole design decision here. A function-scoped fixture is only live
# between its own setup and teardown, and pytest builds higher-scoped
# fixtures first and tears them down last, so a handler it installed
# would miss exactly the runs worth policing: the module-scoped fixture
# that drives all eighty-one emit paths, the integration lane's
# module-scoped uvicorn boot, and anything a module teardown emits.
# Strict mode used to cover those because it raised from inside the
# emitter, at whatever scope was running, and a replacement that covers
# less is not a replacement.
#
# So the ledger below runs for the whole session and the per-test
# fixture reads a DELTA off it. A refusal made in a module fixture's
# setup is attributed to the test that first asked for that fixture,
# which is the test whose failure a reader can act on. What is left over
# at the end of the run belongs to no test at all (a session or module
# teardown, an atexit hook) and is reported against the run itself
# rather than dropped.
#
# Under xdist there is one ledger per process, which is right for the
# per-test half (the test and its fixtures ran in that process) and not
# enough for the residual half: the run's exit status and the terminal
# summary belong to the controller, which has neither the refusal nor a
# way to hear about it. So a worker's residual is handed up over
# `workeroutput` and the controller does the reporting and the failing,

    `logs.configure` removes every handler on the root logger and adds
    one of its own, bound to whatever `sys.stderr` was at that moment.
    Under pytest that handler is bound to a capture stream belonging to
    the test that installed it, and pytest's own capture handler is one
    of the ones removed. A later test in the same worker then emits a
    record into a stream nobody owns any more, the handler raises, and
    `logging` prints its `--- Logging error ---` fallback: the RAW
    record, arguments and all, straight to the real stderr.

    That is why this is a guard rather than a tidy-up. The dump bypasses
    every formatter, so it defeats exactly the assertions a no-leak test
    makes, and it lands on a test that did nothing wrong: it was a
    conversation-erasure case that failed on CI, holding a URL with its
    own sentinel in it, three files away from the test that had
    reconfigured logging (#413). The blame belongs where the state was
