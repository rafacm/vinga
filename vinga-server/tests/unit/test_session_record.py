"""The record one turn hands the conversation store.

The content channel is separate from the event tap on purpose (#120):
tool arguments and results never rode the events at all, and the events
are about to lose their text, so what the store is fed comes from the
reply path itself. What that path assembles is what these tests are
about, driven through the same session drivers every other suite uses
and read off a spy standing where the store will stand.

The channel is optional and dormant: nothing constructs a store yet, so
a session built without one must behave exactly as it did before this
existed. The last test here says so directly, and the event-assertion
and pin suites say it by passing unmodified.
