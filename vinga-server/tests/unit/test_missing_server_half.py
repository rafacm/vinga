"""What an installation carrying the client half alone is told.

The default installation of this package is the configuration client,
and the server half is an extra. So six things a person can type are
answerable only by an installation that has that half, and each of them
is answered with a fixed sentence rather than with an ImportError:
`vinga-server` with nothing after it, which means serve; the three
commands of the configuration grammar that read the server's own
modules, `openapi` (which builds the API application to describe it),
`ota-url` (which derives a URL through the onboarding package) and
`check` (which reads the store the way a boot reads it, through the boot
module itself); `vinga-server conversations`, which renders the store's
tables off the SQLAlchemy metadata; and `vinga-server doctor` WITH NO
URL, which derives the URL to diagnose through the same onboarding
package.

That last one is gated at the derivation rather than at the command,
which is the whole of what makes it right: a laptop diagnosing a remote
deployment passes the URL, opens a socket and reads an answer, and
wants nothing of this package's server half. Only the derivation needs
it. A case below drives both halves of that split.

Two sentences and not six: serving is one fact, and needing the other
half is the other, which the remaining five share.

The sentinels are the point of this file. Every one of these refusals is
reached with an ImportError in hand, and an ImportError's text is a
module path, which is the value most likely to be relayed by accident;
the invocation that reached it carries a path, a name or a slot, which
is where a credential lands when it is typed one argument early. So each
case plants a DISTINCT credential-shaped value in every field that could
carry one, one field per sentinel so a leak names its own source, and
asserts absence on all four surfaces the rest of this suite uses:
stdout, stderr, every log record rendered whole, and the exception chain
a walker would find.

The missing half is simulated rather than uninstalled: the import that
would fail is made to fail, with a sentinel in the message it fails
with. A test that needed a second environment could not run here at all,
and the clean-venv lane is where the real absence is proven.
