"""A conversation's life as rows: when one appears, which turns it
refuses, what it is called, and when it stops being current.

Driven through the writer's own surface rather than against
`threads.py` directly, because that is where the lifecycle actually
happens: the row lands inside the transaction that stores its first
turn, and a test that inserted one itself would be pinning a helper
instead of the rule. What comes back is read through a second engine,
which is what a reader beside a running writer is.

The clock is the store's, which is what lets a thread be written as
old or as recent without anything sleeping.

What a title must NOT reach is next door in `test_conversations_session.py`,
where a real conversation is held over a websocket and the sentinel is
hunted through every surface a record can leave on.

The last section is the recap checkpoint, and it is here because both
halves of what a checkpoint means to the store are here: the coverage a
write records, and the reading that honours it.
