"""The `vinga-server conversations` commands.

Two things are worth pinning. That neither `schema` nor `views` opens
anything: both are run against a database that cannot be reached, so a
command that touched it would fail there rather than print. And that no
refusal repeats what was typed, which is the same rule the config group
speaks and the reason both parsers turn argparse's own usage errors into
ConfigErrors.

The group had one command until the metrics views arrived, and the pins
that said so moved with them rather than being loosened: what the
refusal names and what the help offers are still asserted exactly, at
two words instead of one.
