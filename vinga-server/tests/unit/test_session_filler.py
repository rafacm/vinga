"""Latency masking with pre-synthesized conversational fillers.

The silence between the end of an utterance and the first audio of the
reply is where the assistant feels dead: healthy field turns ran 1.5 to
3 s of it, a slow morning a 5.1 s median, and the user's reaction on
record was "Are you there?" (#48). When a reply's first audio has not
started within the configured delay, the session plays a clip
synthesized at boot in the active agent's voice, and the real reply
queues behind its tail (#74).

These tests drive full replies against a scripted slow LLM, with the
delay shrunk to test scale and the mock TTS trimmed to one frame per
clip, and cover the composition with the first-token watchdog: the
filler is the soft early threshold, the watchdog the hard late one.
