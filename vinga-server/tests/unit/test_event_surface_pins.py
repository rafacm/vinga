"""What a session's records must NOT contain, hunted for.

This file used to pin every session event exactly as it was emitted:
channel, level, unrendered template, arguments and field set, restated
per path. That duplication is gone (#210). The declaration is the
template and the argument order now, `docs/reference/events.md` is the
committed contract for names, channels, levels, argument order, types,
requiredness and nullability, and the driver suite
(`test_event_baseline.py`) is the proof that every declared shape is
really emitted. Names and structure are pinned in one artifact, once.

What is left here is the half none of those can carry, and the half the
plan says survives whole: a pin says a sentence is what it is, never
that it is safe. The retained JSON logs are the observability surface
(ADR 2026-08-04) and they carry metadata only: what was said is the
conversation store's (#120, the content-and-telemetry ADR). So a
credential-shaped sentinel is planted where a far side, a device or a
person's own words enter the session, and it is hunted through:

- the record's rendered sentence and its unrendered arguments;
- every field of its payload;
- both formats a deployment can be shipping, JSON and text;
- every other record of the run, at every level;
- and an attached tap, because a consumer is handed the same arguments
  the record carries and reading only the log would miss it.

Absence is asserted beside the thing the event exists for, so a test
that passed by emitting nothing at all fails instead.

The sentinels for what the emitter itself may say when a construction
is refused live in `test_event_enforcement_sentinels.py`; these are the
sentinels for what a lawful record may say.

The file keeps its name. What it pins is still the event surface, in
the one dimension no declaration can carry: the reference says which
fields exist and the driver suite says a record really carries them, and
neither can say that what a stranger sent is not in one of them.

The driving is the driver harness's, imported rather than repeated:
those drivers are where every session path is reached from now, and a
second copy of them here would be a second thing to keep working.
