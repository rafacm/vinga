"""Applying the stored configuration to a running server.

The MCP half is exercised against real servers in
`test_tools_mcp_reload.py` and the transport around the route is
`test_config_api_runtime.py`'s. What is left here is what the
generalized apply itself decides: which slices of the stored world it
installs, what it refuses when they do not add up with the ones it is
keeping, what it reports having done, and what a live session reads once
it has done it.

The overlay is most of the file, and its cases are chosen for the shape
they share: a stored edit reaches a running session or it does not, and
which one it is has to follow the field rather than the entity. An
agent's own prompt reaches it; the fragments every agent inherits
through `agent_defaults` do not, because the effective-value helpers
read that layer and installing it would apply a start-bound change
through the back door.

The filled pauses are the second half of the file and are the same shape
one step on: what an apply decides about a clip follows the two things a
clip is made of, each read from the world it belongs to. The engines are
the third and the same shape again, one entry at a time. So the
assertions in both are about object identity as much as about names,
because "nothing was sent to a voice" and "no model was loaded" are not
things a name list can say.
