"""Where the CLI sends a command, and what it will not send it over.

The config command group is an API client before it is anything else,
and this is the half of it that has nothing to do with what a command
means: which address it resolves, which token it sends, which
connections it refuses to send either over, how long it waits, and what
it says when there is nothing at the other end.

The rule the refusals here keep is one rule. The bearer token rides on
every request and grants everything the API can do, so the connection
carrying it is loopback or TLS, for the whole client rather than for the
commands that look sensitive, and with no flag to override it. What the
refusals must not do is publish what they refused: a URL is where a
token gets pasted by mistake, and the parser's own exceptions carry the
text they choked on.

The timeouts are here for the same reason they are constants: the read
bound outlasts the database's busy timeout so that contention reaches
the operator as the sentence the API answers with rather than as a
client-side transport error, and the apply's bound outlasts the
registry's own envelope so that nobody is left not knowing what is
running.
