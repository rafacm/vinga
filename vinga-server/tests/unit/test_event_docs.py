"""The two documents the event surface has, and what each is held to.

The generated reference is held to everything: it IS the catalog
rendered, and CI regenerates it and diffs it byte for byte, so a field,
a token, a level or a bound that moves without the document moving with
it turns the lane red. The tests here are the completeness half of that,
which a diff cannot give: a generator that silently skipped an event
would produce a document CI is perfectly happy with.

The README index is held to names only, and deliberately so. It carried
field and token claims in prose once, which nothing parsed and nothing
could: prose can go stale while a name-level check stays green, and
half-checked documentation reads as checked. So the schema claims live
in the generated reference now and the index says what exists and when
it fires, which is exactly what these tests check it says: every
declared event in exactly one row, every row a declared event, and no
duplicates. A wording edit passes; a dropped, invented or duplicated row
does not.

Both halves read the catalog, which since #210 is the one place a
declaration lives. There is no second description to compare against and
none to fall out of step.
