"""The `session` noun: four verbs over the API, and what they print.

The one part of this grammar that reads a schema the domain
configuration knows nothing about, and it reads it the same way as
everything else here: as requests through the client seam, against a
server built per command. There is no local-database path and there is
not going to be one (#281, #282), so a store is seeded with the real
writer and the commands are held to what the API answers about it.

Two properties this file exists for, beyond the round trips:

- **Printed content cannot steer a terminal.** A title, an agent name
  and a board's self-description all originate in what a room said to a
  device or what an operator typed, so every cell and every block line
  goes through the merged `printable` bounding. The tests plant ANSI
  escapes, control characters, tabs and newlines and compare the two
  streams byte for byte at a terminal and through a pipe.
- **A destructive verb asks, and its refusals name no value.** The two
  erasures are registered destructive, so they confirm at a terminal and
  take `--force`; what they say when they refuse is a fixed sentence,
  and the sentinel is hunted through stderr and the log.
