"""A server serving a configuration it was handed rather than read.

The shape a test lane has and an embedded caller can have: nothing
migrated a database before the app was built, so the snapshot the server
was given is the whole truth there is, and it is authoritative for
exactly that reason (`device/bindings.py`). What follows is what this
module is about. The mounted API opens a database beside that snapshot
and writes land in it, but nothing this process serves reads it, so the
two surfaces that span both sides have nothing to span: a comparison
would put the running world against a description of some other server,
and an apply would install that description as this server's whole
domain half.

All three answers are taken through a real server with its lifespan
entered, because the mode is decided by how the server was composed and
a stub would be asserting on the stub.
