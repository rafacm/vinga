"""The client's contract, held against the committed document as DATA.

Every other check of these two halves compares them through the models
they share, which is the one comparison that cannot fail: a field
renamed on a response model moves the API's declaration and the CLI's
reading together, and both stay green while the published contract says
something else. So this reads
`docs/reference/api-openapi.json` as bytes on disk and holds the
grammar's acts to what it says, importing nothing of `config.api` and
building no application. What a generated client would be built from is
exactly what is compared here, which is why this is also the oracle #287
inherits: when the client is generated rather than written, this test is
what says the generator was pointed at the right document.

Three things are compared, in both directions.

- **Which operations exist.** The covered set is derived from
  `cli.COMMANDS` by asking each act for the path it addresses, and the
  exclusion set below names every operation no act covers, with a reason
  apiece. The two are asserted to union to the whole document and to
  overlap nowhere, which is what makes a NEW route a failing test rather
  than an operation nobody noticed: an operation in neither set fails
  from the side it is missing from.
- **What each act sends.** `Act.sends` against the operation's request
  body, both ways, because the four bodies with adapters in front of
  them (a binding, a secret, the default agent, an applied document) are
  exactly the ones a method-and-path comparison leaves free to drift.
- **What each act is answered with.** `Act.answers` against the
  operation's success response, so a renderer reading a shape the server
  stopped sending is a failure here rather than a refusal a user meets.

The paths are not written down. Each act's `path` is a function of an
invocation, so it is given one whose identities are their own parameter
names and asked what it addresses; percent-encoding is undone
afterwards, since a path parameter is the one thing in a URL that is not
a literal. That way the comparison runs through the production code that
builds the address rather than past it.
