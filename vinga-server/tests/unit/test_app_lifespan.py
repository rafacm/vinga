"""What an app that is never served holds, and what a served one lets go.

The acceptance criterion of #142 is a negative one: `create_app`
describes an application and acquires nothing, so an app that is built
and never entered has no engine, no thread, no model and no file. It
cannot be proved by reading the function, because the leak it replaced
was exactly that (a bindings engine opened at build and disposed in a
lifespan nothing entered), so it is proved here by sentinels around the
three acquisitions that cost something: the bindings pool, the
conversation store's file, and the providers.

The other two directions are the same claim from the other end: a
lifespan that is entered and left releases everything it took, and a
build that fails part way through releases what it had taken by then.
That last one is what the exit stack is for: every acquisition registers
its release as it is made, so there is no window in which a later
failure strands an earlier resource.

The startup-failure bridge is here too, because it is the same seam: a
boot failure inside the lifespan is caught, recorded as its sanitized
sentence, and re-raised as `StartupFailed` with nothing chained to it,
which is what keeps an operator's stderr to one line.
