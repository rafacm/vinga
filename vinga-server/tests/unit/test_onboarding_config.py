"""The configuration keys the short onboarding path is built on.

`server.onboarding` (the switch and the pinned key), `server.public_url`
(the origin the startup banner names), and what `server.ota_path` gains:
null to unmount the legacy route, and `/x/` reserved beside `/api/`.
`server.websocket_url` is here too, because what made its refusals
stricter is this milestone: the OTA endpoint's GET renders it verbatim,
and the short path serves that GET to anyone holding the onboarding URL.

Three values here are credentials of a sort and are checked never to be
quoted back: a pinned onboarding key is the segment the token issuer is
served under, and a public or websocket URL a person pasted may carry
userinfo. The sentinel below is checked against everything a refusal can
reach, the way `test_config_env_names.py` does it.
