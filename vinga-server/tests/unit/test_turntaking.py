"""The floor, decided without a pipeline behind it.

`TurnTaking` reaches the orchestrator through four of its methods and
the device through `DeviceOutput`, so both can be scripted and the gate
ladder driven straight onto each of its rungs: the speech floor, the
mid-transcription merge, the playback-onset refractory window, a
confirmation that heard nothing, and a confirmation that heard
something. No session, no socket, no provider.

The second half is the arithmetic in front of the gates, which nothing
used to exercise directly at all: the tail cap that bounds a
continuously listening session's buffer, and the pre-roll trim that
maps the endpointer's speech-start offset onto what is left of the
buffer after the cap has cut at it.
