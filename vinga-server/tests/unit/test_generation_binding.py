"""Which world a connection ends up holding, and when it lets go.

A conversation is built from one generation and speaks through that
generation's engines until it ends, so "which world is this connection
holding" is what decides when a world an apply replaced may release what
it holds (#191). The accounting has two states rather than one, and this
file is the four cases that prove why: a session is admitted before it
has proved anything, and the ones below are turned away without a
conversation ever being built for them.

The edge is driven through `run` rather than through a helper, because
what is under test is the control flow: which statement the binding sits
after, and which paths reach it. The `finally` that gives a slot back is
the websocket endpoint's, so each case does what that endpoint does, in
its order.
