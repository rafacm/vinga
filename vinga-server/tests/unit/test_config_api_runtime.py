"""The `/runtime` namespace: what the server is doing, not what is
stored.

The status read answers from the MCP registry the serving application
was handed, the prompt read from the assembly the composition root
closed over, the diff read from the comparison it closed over, and the
identity read from the value it composed, so what is checked here is the
transport around them: the gate, the shape, the honest answer when there
is no server, and the one structural reason this namespace exists at
all, that an entity may legally be named after a word a route wants.

The identity read has one thing the others do not, and it is read for it
here: the URL it answers is a credential, so the gate in front of it and
the `no-store` on the way back are its behavior rather than its
surroundings.

# forbids. The registry handed in here has never been started, so its

# so that no await can land between them, and this route adds nothing
