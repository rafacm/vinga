"""`vinga simulator run`'s websocket half, against a peer a case
controls.

The integration lane drives this against a real vinga-server, which is
the compatibility claim only a real server can make. This file makes the
claims a real server cannot be asked for, and that is why it exists
rather than overlapping:

- the four handshake headers, read off the peer's own recording.
  `Protocol-Version` is read by NOTHING on the server side, so a
  conversation that succeeded against a real server would say nothing
  about whether it was sent;
- every adversarial answer. A malformed hello, a `tts stop` with no
  start, a truncated binary frame, a close carrying credential-shaped
  bytes: a correct server produces none of them, and each is a shape this
  client has to have a decided answer to;
- the no-leak inventory of the websocket half, five cases, each planting
  its own sentinel on all four surfaces.

The utterance is real and the pacing is not. `conversation.sleep` is
replaced, because the packets are twenty-eight sixty-millisecond frames
and waiting them out per case would be most of a minute across this file
for no assertion at all; the pacing itself is asserted once, against that
same seam, which is the only thing a real sleep would have added.
