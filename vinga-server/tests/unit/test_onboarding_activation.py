"""The activation ceremony as a device meets it.

What an unbound board receives at its configuration check, what it
receives once it is bound, and what `/activate` answers in between, on
both the legacy OTA path and the short onboarding one. The pending table
itself is tested in test_onboarding_pending.py; here it is the app's own,
reached the way a request reaches it.

The request shapes mirror `Ota::CheckVersion` and `Ota::Activate` in
78/xiaozhi-esp32: the headers the firmware sets, the body it sends for
each activation version, and the status codes it acts on (202 keep
waiting, 200 activated, anything else a failure).
