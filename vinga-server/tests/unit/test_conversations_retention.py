"""Retention: what leaves the store, and what "leaves" means.

Deletion here is the right-to-delete made operational, and what that
promises is now the database server's rule rather than a file trick
(#283). Precisely: a deleted row is invisible to every transaction that
begins after the deletion commits, including the analyst role's; a
repeatable-read transaction already in flight when it commits keeps
seeing the row until it ends, which is what MVCC is; and reclaiming the
pages the row occupied is autovacuum's, not a per-delete overwrite.

The held-snapshot case below pins both halves of that in one test,
which is the honest replacement for the SQLite-era pair it retires. Two
tests went with the mechanism: one that hunted a planted credential
through `conversations.db` and both of its sidecars after a deferred
truncating checkpoint, and one that pinned the checkpoint running
outside a transaction. Neither has an analogue: there is no file to
read, no write-ahead log to truncate, and no freed page this process
could write zeros over.

Nothing sleeps. The store takes a wall clock, so a session recorded
"ninety-one days ago" is a clock the test chose, and the cutoff
boundary is asserted on the day either side of it rather than
approached.
