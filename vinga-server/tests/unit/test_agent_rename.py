"""One rename, three schemas, one transaction.

`ConfigStore.rename_agent` is the first write in this server that spans
the domain half, the memory schema and the conversation record at once,
and the properties it has to have are not properties of any one of them.
This suite is about the transaction rather than about the SQL.

What it pins:

- **The sentinel sweep**, which is this file's central claim. One agent
  named a value nothing else in the fixture holds, referenced from every
  live place at once, is renamed; then every row of every table of the
  three schemas is read and rendered as text, and the set of
  `(table, column)` pairs still carrying the sentinel is compared with a
  recorded set. It fails in both directions: a live reference left
  behind, and a dated column that stopped carrying the name it is
  supposed to keep. What it is a claim about is bounded and stated where
  the set is written down: values a fixture wrote, not a schema that can
  name its own agent references.
- **The inventory pin**, so the sweep cannot silently stop covering the
  domain half. `check_references` is what the repository itself calls a
  reference to an agent, it is empty after a rename, and it is shown to
  be non-empty over the same state with one binding put back.
- **The seven refusals**, one case per state of the transaction before
  it writes: one absent source, three occupied destinations, two
  malformed new names, one contended database. Each collision case
  builds its destination in ONE store and leaves it empty in the other
  two, so a check that stopped running fails rather than passing for the
  wrong reason.
- **Atomicity**, driven from the last statement: with the memory rewrite
  refused by the database, the agents row, the bindings, the default
  agent and the threads are all as they were.
- **Reversibility**, which is what the no-confirmation decision rests
  on: rename and rename back, and all three schemas are byte-identical.
  Run a second time with a stranger present, which is the assertion a
  merge fails while a plain round trip passes.
- **The competing write**, once per store that checks a destination: a
  second writer of the same chain, released exactly between the check
  and the update, is queued on the lock rather than landing inside the
  decision. The waiter is required to be that writer's own backend by
  pid, because this lane runs its files across worker processes against
  one instance and a count of anybody's waiters would have been
  satisfied by a suite next door.
- **The order the lock and the check are issued in**, which the three
  pins above cannot see: each of them starts its writer at the statement
  that WRITES, so all three would still pass with a chain's lock taken
  between the destination check and the update rather than before both.
  That is asserted directly, off the statements the one connection
  sends.

Every thread here is minted per test, because a deletion names an id for
the life of the process and a suite that reused one would be arranging
something no server can meet.
