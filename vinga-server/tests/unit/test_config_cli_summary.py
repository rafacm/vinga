"""The commands that render the whole masked configuration, and the
document all of them render it from.

Three of them, one act apiece and the same act: `list` prints the tree,
`show` prints the document as the YAML file has it, and `export` prints
the same document as the applicable one. (`info` prints a count per
kind off the same read; its own file is beside this one, because what
that command is about is which deployment answered.) `ConfigDocument`
declares that document as `dict[str, Any]` and stops there,
deliberately: the entity models cannot validate an entry whose
credential-bearing values have been replaced by the mask. So everything
these renderers walk into is a body nobody has vouched for, and it
arrives from whatever answered at `--api-url`.

Two halves, in the order they matter. The first is the renderings
themselves, pinned whole: each is what an operator reads a deployment
off, and `export` is a file another deployment is built from, so a line
moving is a change to the artifact rather than to an implementation.
The byte-exact pins are what make the gate below a refactor rather than
a rewrite. The second is the gate: every section is read as the shape
the registry says it has, so a section that is a scalar, a list or
absent meets the one fixed sentence a body this client cannot read
gets, and every value that reaches a line goes through the display door
on its way to the terminal.
