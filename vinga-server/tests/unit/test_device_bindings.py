"""The live view of device bindings, at the edges a device reaches it.

Every test here boots one app on a real database and then writes to that
database through the repository, which is what an operator binding a
board does while the server runs. Nothing is rebuilt afterwards: the
whole claim of this milestone is that the same running app answers
differently, so a test that built a second app would be asserting the
boot-time snapshot instead.

`from_store=True` on every app here, and it is not ceremony: a server
whose domain half was read from a store resolves bindings live, and one
composed from a `Config` handed to it serves that snapshot
authoritatively (#283). `booted()` really does read the store, so these
apps say so; the two tests below whose subject IS the snapshot-only mode
compose their configuration in Python and say nothing, which is how they
get it.
