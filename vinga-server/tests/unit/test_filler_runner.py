"""The latency mask, decided without a pipeline behind it.

`FillerRunner` reaches the device through `DeviceOutput` and whoever
holds the floor with two reads, so both can be scripted and the
timer driven onto each of its outcomes: the fire that masks a slow
reply, the reply that spoke first, an agent with no clip of its own,
the two stand-downs that yield to the user, and the arbitration between
a clip already sounding and the reply's own audio arriving. No session,
no socket, no synthesis.

The clips here are PCM this module made up, at the device's own output
rate, because what a clip contains is `filler.py`'s business and what
this runner does with one is the same whatever it holds.
