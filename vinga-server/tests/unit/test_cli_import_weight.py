"""The shape that makes the CLI extractable, held by three assertions.

Issue #287 is the exit this repository has decided on and deliberately
not taken: if the configuration CLI is ever published on its own, it
becomes a client generated from the committed OpenAPI document, with the
server on the other side of an HTTP boundary and no shared import at
all. Structuring for that exit is worth nothing as an intention, so it
lands as three tests that fail when it stops being true.

1. **The reach is an inventory.** The exact set of `vinga_server`
   modules that importing `config.cli` pulls in at module scope is
   written down. Widening it is a review event with a name, and #287's
   gap census becomes a diff of this set rather than fresh archaeology.

2. **The dependency arrow points one way.** Nothing under
   `vinga_server` imports `config.cli` except `main.py`, in the branch
   that dispatches to it. That one edge is the declared exception and
   the only one an extraction would have to cut.

3. **Answers are read through `config/responses.py` alone.** That
   module imports nothing of this server, because it is the half a
   generated client substitutes for. The CLI never validates an answer
   against a server-side model.

The first runs in a subprocess, because the assertion is about what an
import pulls in and this suite's own `sys.modules` has the whole server
in it already. The other two read the source, because an import graph
answers what was reached at run time and the question here is what is
written down.

# Every `vinga_server` module importing `config.cli` loads, and the
# reason each is on the list.
#
# Twenty-six, and each of them is the client half of something: the
# models and the registry the grammar is derived from, the loader that
# reads the file half, the renderers the four document commands print,
# the response shapes the answers are read through, the transport policy
# a fragment is checked against before it travels, and the logging
# boundary that quiets the request loggers. `runtime.prompt` and
# `tools.names` arrive under `models`, which declares an agent's
# fragments and an MCP grant's tool names in their own types.
#
# Seven arrived with `vinga simulator` (#248), deliberately and as a
# review event with a name, which is what this list is for.
# `device_endpoint` is the device-facing address policy and the request
# boundary the doctor and the simulator share; `simulator.board` and
# `simulator.capabilities` are the grammar's two concrete imports, in the
# empty package they sit in; and `protocol` and its three modules arrive
# under them, because the simulator holds no copy of the wire and reads
# the same module the server does. Every one of them is client-tier
# pure: the whole of `protocol` imports `json`, `struct`, `dataclasses`,
# `collections.abc` and pydantic and nothing else.
#
# `simulator.utterance` joined them in M2 of #248: it is what the
# packaged sentence IS, which is `json`, `dataclasses`,
# `importlib.resources` and `protocol.framing`, and nothing about
# reading a file the wheel already carries is behind an extra.
#
# `simulator.conversation` is deliberately NOT here, and
# `test_the_simulator_s_conversation_half_is_not_imported_eagerly` below
# says so: it is the only module in the tree that imports `websockets`,
# and M2's extra gate depends on that import happening inside `run`'s own
# arm rather than at the top of the grammar.
#
# `broken_pipe` joined them with `events tail` (#342), and it is the
# cheapest entry on this list: `os`, `signal` and `sys`, and nothing of
# this server at all. It is here rather than duplicated because what it
# holds is a two-part trap (the shell's status for a process cut off by
# SIGPIPE, and the descriptor redirection that keeps the interpreter's
# final flush from raising again), and the other program that answers a
# closed pipe is `events_cli`, which the client tier may not reach: it
# would drag the whole event catalog in behind it.
#
# `config.server_reference` joined them with the `reference` verb's HALF
# selector (#396). It renders the server half's page out of the same
# models `docgen` renders the domain half from, and its whole import list
# is `docgen`, `entities`, `loader`, `models`, `textwrap` and
# annotated-types: the grammar was already paying for every one of them,
# so what this entry costs is one module object.
#
# What is NOT here is the other point of the list: no `store`, so no
# SQLAlchemy; no `secrets`, so no cryptography; no `api` and no
# `onboarding`, so no FastAPI; no `db`, so no Alembic. Each of those
# left in the #223 milestone, and each would come back one convenient
# import at a time.
