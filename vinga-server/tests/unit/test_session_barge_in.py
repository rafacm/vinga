"""The gates in front of a barge-in.

An utterance the endpointer ends while a reply is in flight may cancel
that reply only on evidence of user speech: enough classified speech,
and a transcript confirming it when nothing faster decides it. A reply
still inside ASR is holding the head of the user's own sentence, so
there the barge-in merges instead of destroying it. A manual `listen stop` mid-reply is a
deliberate act and keeps the unconditional cancel.

The websocket tests drive the gates the way the firmware would; the
session-level tests hold a reply inside a hand-gated ASR to hit the
windows a real socket cannot time.
