"""What owns a provider, and what lets go of one.

A provider used to be built once and held for the life of the process,
so there was nothing here to test: the boot either produced four engines
per agent or refused, and nothing was ever released. Applying stored
configuration without a restart makes both halves real, and this file is
about them (#191).

Two properties run through everything below. Ownership begins the
instant an allocation succeeds, so no exit that is not an install leaves
an object behind; and letting go waits for the work rather than for the
caller, because a worker thread does not stop when the coroutine
awaiting it is cancelled.

The fake provider is what makes the first assertable: a real one holds a
client or a model, and "was it closed" is not a question either of those
answers. The last section is the other direction and uses the real
classes, because a suite that only ever closed a fake would pass with
every concrete provider inheriting the no-op.
