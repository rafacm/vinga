"""What a read shows of a URL credential written before the rule (#381).

Since #279 a URL carrying a credential is refused at every write, an MCP
server's `url` and a provider's `base_url` alike, and no record made
from an entry carries one. Write time was all of it: a row stored before
that rule, or written straight into the database by something that never
passed through a write, still boots and still reads, and every display
built on the view walk read it back verbatim.

The rows here are planted rather than written, because the write path
refuses them. Each is the model's own dump put in place by
`stores.planted`, which is what a value that never met a write looks
like, and it is the least machinery that is still honest: the shape
under test is a lawful row holding an unlawful value, not a body no
model can parse.

Every display is asserted as a pair, because either half alone is
passable: the sentinel is nowhere in the answer, and the address without
it is in it. A view that dropped the field, or the whole entry, would
satisfy the absence half and fail here.

The surfaces are the ones the walk sits under: a single read, a listing,
the whole-configuration document, the API routes over them and the CLI
renderings over those. The export is the one where stripping changes an
outcome rather than a rendering, so it has cases of its own: a document
exported from a store holding such a row used to be one its own import
path refused whole.

Three later sections carry the rule past the displays, because the same
row is spoken as well as shown. A refusal says a stored identity on a
server's stderr as it fails to start (#382), and the build that runs
after the composition says one again in a vocabulary of its own: the
label every provider refusal names an entry by, and the identity every
event about that provider carries (#413). The last section is where the
same rule under the build's other noun, the MCP entries an agent
references, turns out to be defence rather than a leak, and says why
(#420).

# The MCP build, which now names its entry where every other location is
#
# The provider half of the build is above. The other half builds the MCP
# entries some agent references, and it composed its two boot refusals
# by joining `mcp_servers.` to a stored name by hand: the egress rule
# `server.local_only` applies to every referenced entry, and whatever an
# entry that will not construct is reported as. #413's sweep named both
# and left them out of its own change rather than widening into it, on
# the reading that they were the same hole under a different noun
# (#420).
#
# They are not. What follows is measured rather than assumed, and it is
# the one place the two nouns come apart. A provider name is held to one
# URL path segment at WRITE time only, so a row stored before that rule
# composes and reaches the build carrying whatever it holds. An MCP
# entry name is held again at COMPOSITION time, by
# `models.check_mcp_entry_names` on the domain model, because the name
# becomes a tool-name prefix: a stored name outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`
# refuses the whole snapshot before a `Config` exists, and no credential
# can be spelled inside that charset. So these two refusals cannot be
# reached with such a name at all, and reading the location through
# `entity_location` is defence and one home rather than a fix of
# something an operator can meet, exactly as the location
# `provider_for_agent` answers with is.
#
# The four cases are that reasoning, in the order it has to hold: the
# composition really does refuse such a name, a boot over such a row
# really does say nothing of it, the two sentences really are composed
# where every other location over an entry identity is, and they really
# are composed by READING that helper rather than by spelling what it
# happens to return. The last of those exists because the first three
# cannot say it: the charset that makes this defence also makes the
# helper's answer identical to the hand-built string it replaced, so
# nothing about a lawful name can tell the two spellings apart.

# A lawful MCP entry name, which is what the charset leaves.

# An environment variable nothing sets, named so that nothing else can
