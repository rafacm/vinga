"""The diff read as the composition root wires it: one world, or a
refusal.

The transport around the route is `test_config_api_runtime.py`'s and
what the comparison decides is `test_config_diff.py`'s and
`test_mcp_pending.py`'s. What is left here is what only the composition
root does, and all three parts of it are things a stub cannot show.

The stored half is the re-read the reload begins with, so a stored world
that fails it is refused here under the status it would be refused under
there, in a sentence of this route's own rather than the store's, which
takes a real database and a real key to demonstrate. The
running half is read either side of that database read, so an answer is
one world or it is no answer at all, which takes a reload landing in the
middle of one. And nothing of a credential travels, which takes a
credential: a plaintext, the ciphertext the database holds and the mark
taken over it, for the value this server booted with and again for the
value stored while it runs, plus the name of an environment variable,
are seven distinct sentinels here, each asserted absent from the answer,
from a refusal, and from what the server wrote about either.
