"""What a refusal is about, and which field it says it about.

Two claims meet here, which is why they share a file. The first is that
the sentence a refusal carries is the repository's own, unchanged by the
transport: an operator meets one vocabulary whichever way they reached
the API. That was held by goldens until #242, which is to say by copies
of the sentences, so an edit to prose that changed nothing an operator
does turned this file red. It is held differentially now: the same act
is driven through the repository directly and over HTTP, and the two
answers are compared with neither of them written down here. What is
compared per refusal beside that is structure and semantics: the status,
the one body shape, the entity the refusal is about, the number of
problems it decomposes into, and the field each one addresses.

The second claim is that the structured half says the same thing as the
sentence and adds a place to put it: every emitter answers one shape,
the `errors` entries and the `detail` lines are one computation seen
twice, and a pointer addresses the field a form would mark, escaped
where a key holds a dot or a slash. And under both, the standing one:
nothing of what was sent comes back, in the sentence, in a pointer, in
a message, or in the log. The no-leak assertions are not wording pins
and did not retreat.

Beside them, the pydantic mechanism the structured half rests on: a
`ValueError` raised inside a model validator is reachable from
`ValidationError.errors()` as the error's context, which is what lets a
validator that knows its semantic field hand its problems up. A
pydantic release that stopped carrying it would silently flatten every
model-level refusal to one location, so it is pinned rather than
assumed.
