"""Opening the domain configuration schema: migration, reopen, refusal.

The database is opened by the server at boot and by every CLI
invocation, so the interesting cases are the ones that happen without
anybody watching: a blank database, a schema that is already current,
two processes doing either at the same moment, and an instance that is
not there at all.

What retired with SQLite is named here rather than left as an absence,
because the deletions are half of this change. The uncreatable and
unwritable directory cases go with the directory; the stranded-database
family (a file stamped at a revision the squash deleted) goes with the
file, because the only databases carrying those stamps are SQLite files
this build cannot open at all, so no Postgres database can reach the
arm. What replaces both is one refusal for an instance this server
cannot use, tested below.
