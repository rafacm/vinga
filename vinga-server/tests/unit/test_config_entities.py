"""The descriptor registry, held to the surfaces it describes.

The registry is only worth having if it says what the rest of the
package says. Four relations are pinned here: that every descriptor
names a real domain key, that the command it carries reaches the
sentence the loader refuses a moved section with, that the two tiers
the documentation renders are the two tiers the registry declares, and
that stored secrets hang on exactly two kinds, which is a `Literal` in
one place and a descriptor fact in another.

The fifth is the module's own claim, and since #210 it is a claim
rather than an aspiration: a descriptor is whole the moment this module
is imported, with nothing installed onto it afterwards by a consumer.
Two tests hold it, because there are two ways to break it. A consumer
can reach past the frozen dataclass with `object.__setattr__`, which is
what `fill` did, and that is caught by comparing every fact of every
entry against a child interpreter that imported the registry alone. Or
the dataclass can stop being frozen, at which point ordinary assignment
does it, and that is caught by assigning.
