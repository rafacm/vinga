"""What a failure inside a reply is taken for.

The reply body's outer catch reads the same moment in one of two ways: the
device went away, which is ordinary and stays silent, or something here is
broken, which is a bug and belongs on the record. Issue #137 separated them.
The device edge translates both of the transport's vanished-device shapes into
`DeviceGone`, so the body can catch that type alone, and everything else, a
provider's request failure included, reaches the reporting arm instead of being
read as a disconnect.

Two halves, per the plan. The first pins that a provider call failing mid-reply
is reported as a provider failure and never swallowed. The second is the half
that changed: a bare `RuntimeError` raised while speaking is now a bug on the
record, while a `DeviceGone` raised in the same place is still nothing at all.

What that record may say is the third thing pinned here. The arm that reports
now catches everything a provider raises, so it names the exception's class and
stops there: no traceback and no message text, neither of which is ours to
trust once it has been anywhere near a response body.

The fourth is what the user hears, which used to be nothing at all. The last
section drives the phrase that arm now says (#384), the two arms that still say
nothing, and the switch that puts a deployment back where it was.
