"""The progress line the two long waits draw, and everything it may not
do.

`import` waits for a transaction nothing bounds and `apply` waits up to
a minute, so both narrate the wait on stderr while it runs. That is the
interactive affordance the determinism practice licenses
(`docs/architecture/cli-guide.md`), and a licence is a set of
conditions rather than a permission: the non-terminal path stays
complete and byte-identical, the line re-presents only what that path
delivers anyway, and it carries no value the caller typed.

Each condition is a test here rather than a sentence anywhere. The
determinism proof is the load-bearing one and it is made twice over. Its
narrow half is below: one command run at a terminal and through a pipe,
and the piped bytes compared against a run with the affordance
monkeypatched away entirely. Its broad half is the rest of this suite,
which runs with stderr redirected into a capture and would show these
carriage returns in the middle of a few hundred assertions about output
if the terminal check were ever to stop being made.
