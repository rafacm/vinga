"""The generated schema reference, and the committed copy of it.

Three things are worth pinning, all of them the same discipline the
domain configuration's docgen suite keeps. That every column really is
described, since an undescribed column is a hole in the only document
the store has. That the rendering is deterministic and the committed
copy matches it, which is what CI diffs byte for byte. And that the
document says the things a column renderer cannot derive: the
compatibility promise, the retention default, what deletion means at
the level of the file, and where the event vocabulary is defined.
