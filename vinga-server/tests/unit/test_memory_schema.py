"""Opening the memory schema: migration, reopen, the id, and the lock.

The domain database's suite next door covers the shared machinery, so
what is left here is what is specific to a third store: that it really
is a third schema with a chain of its own inside one database, that its
migrations ship inside the package a wheel is built from, that its row
ids come from a sequence, and that its advisory key is somebody else's
neither in value nor in effect.

Nothing here reads or writes a fact through the store, and that is a
division of labour rather than a limitation: `read` and `remember` are
`test_memory_store.py`'s subject, and a suite about a schema has to
reach the table itself. The rows planted below are planted through the
schema's own table for that reason.

The store is opened through `open_memory` and the database is inspected
through `db.read_engine` and `db.write_engine`, both of them public
doors onto a database somebody else has migrated. Nothing here reaches
into the store for an engine: what this suite needs of it is the
migration and the disposal.
