"""The committed bodies, and the promise they are committed for.

An entity is stored as its model dumped to JSON (#243). That makes the
model the compatibility surface: nothing about a stored row is written
down anywhere else any more, so what used to be checked by a migration
and a column is checked here instead, by keeping real bodies in the
repository and parsing them with today's models on every run.

The promise is forward-only, and it is the one a beta will stand on.
Every body under `data/domain-bodies/` validates through the model of
its kind, and a change to a model that cannot parse one fails this suite
until either the model tolerates it or the fixture is deliberately
updated with a compatibility decision recorded beside the change. There
is no backward promise and no migration to write: a body carries what
the operator wrote, and a field added to a model is absent from every
body already stored, which is what its declared default is for.

The fixtures are laid out one directory per entity kind, named for the
kind as the registry names it, so the kind a body belongs to is read off
the tree rather than restated in a table here. Each file is a body
exactly as a row holds one.
