"""Comparing what a server is serving with what the database holds.

Two composed worlds and the secrets loaded beside each, which is what
the comparison takes: no database is opened here, because nothing about
judging two configurations equal needs one. The MCP half arrives as the
registry's own answer, so a case about it here is about carrying that
answer through under the right label; what the registry answers is
`test_mcp_pending.py`.

Two properties carry the file. Every kind is reported by the name an
operator addresses it by, a provider's being its stage and its name
together. And nothing but names and labels comes out: the planted
credential, the ciphertext holding it and the mark taken over it are
each asserted absent from the whole answer.

    narrowing is asked about rather than assumed.

    Reached from `ConfigDiff` and selected on carrying a boundary at
    all, deliberately: a set selected on already being narrowed would
    answer the question with itself, so a model added to this read and
    typed with the whole enum would drop out of the comparison instead
    of failing it. Which is the shape of the defect this pin exists for:
    a fifth boundary reaching a field that never sends it.

    The narrowing is therefore its own assertion, made over the models
    this walk found rather than over the ones the table lists.
