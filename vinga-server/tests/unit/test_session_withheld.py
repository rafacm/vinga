"""A reply that leaked a tool call into its own speech.

`test_speech_guard.py` is the rule; this is the reply path around it.
What the rule decides is read here through the things that receive a
reply: what the device was told it is about to hear, what the model is
handed on the next round, what the store kept, and what the logs say
happened.

Four questions, in the order they matter. Which sentences survive, and
that a leak beside a real answer costs only the leak. That both of the
tool loop's sentence sites go through the same door, one sentence
leaving through `push` and one through `flush`. That a reply left with
nothing to say falls back on the phrase #384 cached, and that a reply
which said something first does not. And that a withheld sentence
reaches no surface anybody keeps, which is asserted with a planted
secret rather than by reading the code that drops it.
