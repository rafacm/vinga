"""The two routes that turn a code on a screen into a binding.

The listing answers "which of these is the board on my desk", and the
claim binds it through the same repository call binding by MAC uses, so
reference checking and transactionality are inherited rather than
restated. What is checked here is the transport around that: the path,
the status codes, the sentences, the claim lifecycle under contention,
and the one mechanical constraint the plan names out loud, that the
literal word `pending` never enters MAC normalization.
