"""The guidance an MCP server ships about itself, and the rules it is
consumed under.

Two halves, and the split is deliberate. What a real server does is
proven against the real one: `tests/support/mcp_stdio_server.py` now
declares `instructions` and publishes three prompts, so the capture, the
listing-first discovery, the rendering and the required-argument rule
run over a subprocess and a real transport.

What a *hostile or broken* server does is proven against a stub session,
because those cases are about this client's rules rather than about the
wire: a listing that never ends, a cursor that repeats, a fetch that
stalls, a message carrying an image. A server cooperative enough to be
scripted into those shapes would be a second implementation of the SDK's
server half, and the assertions would be about that instead.
