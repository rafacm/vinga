"""What a key that names an environment variable may hold.

`server.auth.secret_env` and `server.api.secret_env` name the variable
holding a secret; they never hold the secret. The mistake that lands in
them is pasting the value where its variable name belongs, and the
failure that follows quotes the variable name it tells the operator to
set, so a bare non-blank string would print the paste.

Nothing that boots today stops booting: a pasted value never resolved to
a set variable, so such a configuration was already failing, only later
and while echoing what was pasted.

The sentinel below is checked against everything a refusal can reach:
the message, stderr, the captured log records, and the exception chain.
