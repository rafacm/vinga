"""Reloading the MCP servers of a running registry.

The registry is the real one and the servers are the real stdio server
spawned as a subprocess, so what is being diffed, stopped and started
here is what a deployment diffs, stops and starts. What stands in for
the database is the `read` callable the reload takes: the re-read is the
configuration layer's, handed in, which is what lets these tests be
about the two phases rather than about the store.

Two properties carry most of the file. An unchanged entry keeps the
connection it had, proven by identity rather than by state, because a
manager that was stopped and started again would report the same state.
And a refusal changes nothing, proven after each of the four ways
preparation can fail.
