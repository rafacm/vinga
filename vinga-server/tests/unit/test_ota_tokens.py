"""Token issuance from the OTA endpoint.

The endpoint is unauthenticated, because it is the issuer: a token check
here would be circular. What bounds it is who gets a token. A device the
configuration resolves to no agent would be turned away at the websocket
anyway, so it gets nothing to try with, and the `devices` map plus
`default_agent` is therefore the allowlist.

And, since two of the three answers are the same empty string, the word
the reply carries for which of them it is.
