"""The simulator's DEVICE-SIDE half, against a far side a case controls.

Both verbs, because both make the same check-in and read the same reply;
`run`'s own section is at the foot of this file, and what is in it is
what belongs to `run` alone.

The live lane drives this command against a real server, which is the
compatibility claim only a real server can make. It cannot make any of
the claims below, and that is the point of this file rather than an
overlap with it: a correct vinga-server never answers a check-in with a
307, with an `activation` beside a token, with a token that is a number,
or with a websocket URL carrying a password, and every one of those is a
shape this client has to have a decided answer to.

So the far side here is `httpx.MockTransport` behind the command's own
client seam, which records every request it was given and answers
whatever the case says. What that buys is the two halves a real server
cannot supply: the hostile reply table, and the exact request targets of
a ceremony driven through an address carrying a secret path segment and
a query string.
