"""One document, applied whole: what it writes, what it leaves alone,
and what it refuses.

The repository half of `config import`. What makes this a verb of the
repository rather than a loop above it is the transaction: a document
that creates an agent and binds a device to it in the same breath passes
through states no single write would accept, so the reference check runs
once against the state the whole document would leave, and any refusal
leaves nothing behind.

Three properties carry the file. Applying is additive, so a section the
document does not name is untouched and nothing here deletes. Applying
is idempotent by comparison rather than by rewrite, so the same document
twice is a no-op with an outcome listing that says so. And a refusal is
whole and reported whole: every mistake at once, in the sentences the
single writes earn, with the store afterwards exactly what it was.

The creation order is exercised where it is observable, which is not
here: an apply validates once against the finished candidate, so a
complete document resolves whichever order its entries were staged in.
What the order can be held to is the outcome listing, and the edges
themselves are driven through sequential single writes at the foot of
this file, where the wrong order is refused.
