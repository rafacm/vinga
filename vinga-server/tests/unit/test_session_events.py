"""The structured events a conversation emits.

Retained JSON logs are what a deployment measures itself from, so the
shape of these records is a contract: `event`, `session`, and `device`
on every one, plus the per-event fields the server README documents.
They are metadata; the record of what was said is the conversation
store's (#120). The assertions run against
`caplog.records`, because the fields ride `extra=` and never appear in
the message text, which is also what these tests pin: the human sentence
did not change when the fields arrived.
