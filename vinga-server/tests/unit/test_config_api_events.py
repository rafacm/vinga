"""The live event stream: `GET /runtime/events`.

Two mechanisms, and the split is not a preference. The refusals (no
token, no server, a filter that cannot be read) are ordinary buffered
answers and go through the ordinary test client. Everything about a
successful stream does not: a live 200 never completes, so a sync
client that reads a whole body would wait for a server that is
deliberately never going to stop talking, and its transport cannot show
a header before the body it is still waiting for. Those tests drive the
application as ASGI instead, message by message, which is where the
first `http.response.start` is readable and where a chunk can be
asserted while the stream is still open.

The keepalive interval is injected for the same reason: a test that
waited out the default would take fifteen seconds to learn one thing.
