"""The committed OpenAPI document.

The document is the machine-readable contract, so "it generates" has to
mean more than "it is JSON": it is validated with openapi-spec-validator
here, which is what a client generator would do to it, and every $ref in
it has to resolve. The committed copy is diffed against a fresh
rendering the way the markdown reference already is, once in CI and once
here so a stale copy fails in the suite rather than after a push.

It is also deliberately deterministic. A document that varied between
two runs would turn the drift check red on an unrelated change, so the
fixed contract version and the double-render check are both pinned.
