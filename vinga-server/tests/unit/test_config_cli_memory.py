"""The `memory` noun: three verbs over three scopes, and what they
print.

The operator's door onto what an agent, a board and a conversation
remember, driven the way `conversation` is next door: requests through
the client seam, against a server built per command, with memory seeded
through the store an agent writes through.

What this file exists for beyond the round trips is the pair of
properties the memory noun has and the record's nouns do not:

- **Content never rides argv.** A remembered fact is what somebody said
  in a room and a ledger key is a word a model chose, so either can be
  credential-shaped, and the grammar has no positional for either: the
  correction is read from a file or from standard input, the key is read
  from standard input, and a caller who types one meets a usage refusal
  that quotes nothing back. Asserted on the grammar rather than on the
  invocations this file happens to write, because what is claimed is
  that there is no spelling that would carry it.
- **Neither reaches a URL either.** The requests the commands build are
  recorded, and the target a proxy would log carries neither the text
  nor the key.

Beside those, the two the record's verbs already have: content printed
whole and unable to steer a terminal, and a destructive verb that asks
at a terminal, takes `--force` and is refused by `--no-input`.
