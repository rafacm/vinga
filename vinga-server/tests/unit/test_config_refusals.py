"""Which refusal is which, by type.

The CLI prints every refusal as a sentence and needs no distinction.
The REST API answers with a status code, and the plan fixes the mapping:
a missing entity is 404, a lock that did not arrive is 409, unreadable
stored state is 500, and everything else (shape, references, slots,
stage names) is 422. Mapping by reading the message would make the
wording load-bearing, so the refusals carry types instead.

All three subclass ConfigError, so nothing that catches ConfigError
changes; these tests pin the subtype where the status code depends on
it, and the section a refusal is about, which is the half an operator
acts on. The sentence around that is the repository's to choose and is
deliberately not pinned here.

The busy case is forced rather than hoped for: a second connection
holds the domain chain's advisory lock while the lock timeout is short,
once inside the open-and-migrate step (which the API is on the path of
for every request) and once inside a repository write.
