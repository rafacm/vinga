"""What a boot does about the conversation store, and what it does not.

Three states, and the difference between them is the whole of acceptance
criterion 1. An enabled section opens and migrates the `conversations`
schema in the lifespan and starts the writer there too. A disabled or
absent section starts no writer, and the proof that it also *changes*
nothing is the rest of the unit lane passing unmodified beside this
file. The schema is migrated in every one of the three, because
recording being off is not the same as what was recorded being
unreadable.

That last part is where the cutover moved the line (#283). What
"recording off creates nothing" used to mean was that no file was left
behind; there is no file, so what it means now is that no writer is
started and no row is written. Migrating a schema makes empty tables,
which is not a recording, and the tests below say so in exactly those
words.

The store's own behaviour (the markers, the bound, retention) has its
own suites next door. This one is about the wiring.
