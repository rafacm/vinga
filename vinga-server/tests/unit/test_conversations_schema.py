"""Opening the conversation store: migration, reopen, and the ids.

The domain database's suite next door covers the shared machinery, so
what is left here is what is specific to the second store: that it
really is a second schema with a chain of its own inside one database,
that its migrations ship inside the package a wheel is built from, and
that the three cursor tables issue ids a paginating client can trust.

That last one is the reason for the delete-maximum case. Retention
deletes from exactly the end a cursor points past, so a backend that
reissued the highest deleted id would hand a client that had already
read row N a different row N on its next page. Under SQLite that
property was bought with `AUTOINCREMENT` and asserted on the stored
DDL; a Postgres sequence has it by construction, so what is asserted is
the declaration (an identity column, read from `information_schema`)
and the behavior (a delete-then-insert lands past every id ever
issued).
