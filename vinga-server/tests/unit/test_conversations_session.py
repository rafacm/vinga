"""What a real conversation leaves in the store.

The store's own suites drive its seams with hand-built records. This one
holds conversations over a websocket against a booted server and reads
the file afterwards, which is the only place three claims can be checked
at once: that the session row is the same shape as the capture's
manifest, that the events rows are the decision track verbatim, and that
the turn rows and the event rows agree about what happened.

The last of those is the "two sources of one truth" risk the plan names.
A turn is assembled by the reply path while the events flow through the
tap, so the two could drift; the cross-check below makes that a test
failure rather than a discovery during an investigation.

Everything about a wedged database is deterministic rather than timed:
the writer parks on the injected gate, the producer's bound is moved to
zero, and a raising engine is swapped in at a marker. A wall clock is
used for the one thing it has to be, the assertion that a reply does not
wait for any of it.
