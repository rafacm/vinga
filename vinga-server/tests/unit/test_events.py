"""The contract between an emitter and the consumers of what it emits.

The suites next door prove the events themselves: their channel, their
sentences, their fields. This one proves the machinery under them, which
is what #120's conversation store and the #66/#67 exporters will attach
to without touching a single emit site.

Four promises, and each one is a decision rather than an accident:

- a tap sees every event while it is attached, and none after it
  detaches, while the log carries on either way;
- the log is told **last**, so "an event that is logged is an event that
  is recorded" survives literally: the capture is offered the payload
  before the record exists;
- a tap that raises costs its own event and nothing else, and says so in
  a plain sentence rather than in an event that would come back through
  the taps;
- a server-scope consumer attaches once, to the hub, and reaches
  emitters built before and after it attached.

Plus the clocks, which are the reason there are two emitters at all: a
session event is stamped by the session loop, because the capture's
audio is; a server event is stamped by `time.monotonic`, because
`create_app` emits before any loop is running.

This suite is about the machinery rather than the surface, so it emits
shapes the production surface does not have: a handful of synthetic
events whose whole purpose is to be dispatched, copied, and refused by a
broken consumer. They are declared through the public declaration
interface into a catalog of this file's own, which is what keeps them
out of the generated reference and out of the driver suite's
obligations. The
declarations are therefore a second reading of this file: an emission
this suite adds and does not declare fails at import rather than passing
quietly.
