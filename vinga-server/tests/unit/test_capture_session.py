"""A capture taken from a real session, rather than from calls to the
writer.

The unit tests for `capture.py` prove the file format. These prove the
wiring: that the microphone reaches channel 0 before the guards drop it,
that what was paced out reaches channel 1, that the events the session
already logs land in the decision track with offsets that index into the
audio, and that the manifest says what the capture was made against.
