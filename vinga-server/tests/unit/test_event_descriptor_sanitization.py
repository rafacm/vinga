"""What a stranger says about a device, cut down before it is retained.

Four decision sites hand a far-side string to the event surface, and
the #155 provenance inventory found each of them bounding it with
nothing more than a `strip()`. The content-and-telemetry ADR's
2026-08-17 amendment is what makes those fields lawful at all: bounded
device-descriptor metadata is metadata, and "bounded" is the whole of
the permission, so each site now takes an EVENT-ONLY bounded copy.

Event-only is the load-bearing half. The OTA reply has to echo the
firmware version back untouched, because the firmware compares it to
decide whether it is up to date, and `DeviceFacts` keeps the reported
board for a capture manifest. Neither moves; what moves is the payload
field and the sentence's argument, which are the retained surface.

The assertions follow the plan's sentinel model, which has two halves,
one per value class:

- an ADMISSIBLE credential-shaped value, one the bound lets through
  whole, appears in exactly its declared field and its declared
  argument position, on the record, in both shipped formats and on an
  attached tap, and in no other field of any record;
- a REJECTED value, one the bound cuts away, and the pre-sanitization
  form of a value that survives, appear nowhere at all: not in a field,
  not in an argument, not in the rendered sentence, not in either
  format, not on a tap.

Both spellings are shaped so a substring hunt for them cannot match by
accident, which is what makes the second half a real search rather than
a formality.

A fifth site joined them with #427, and it is the same model at a
different bound: `ota_check_body` keeps the whole of what a board
reported, so its section below plants its rejected sentinel past
`CHECK_IN_BODY_LIMIT` rather than past a descriptor's, and asserts the
truncation mechanism as well as the containment.

A sixth joined with #449 M5, and it is the first whose provenance is
not a stranger's: the name an OPERATOR gives a device, carried on
`session_open` so a log reader and an analyst can say which speaker a
session happened on. Nothing about it is untrusted, and the bound is
not there because it might be: a device name is deliberately free-form,
so it may be any length and may hold a newline, and a newline on a
retained line splits one record into two whoever wrote it. The
`DESCRIPTOR` kind is the guarantee the surface needs rather than a
claim about authorship, and the model below is the same model, sentinel
for sentinel.

# --- ota.py: the two ways a stranger's body could have cost more ------

# Both are the PR review round's P1s (#435), and both are about the

# on nothing bigger than the bound being built to reach it, and on the
# building being possible at all for whatever a stranger nests.

    The first half was already true of the `iterencode` version this
    replaced; the second was not, because `iterencode` yields a scalar
    string as one chunk, so an eight-megabyte field was eight megabytes
    built and appended before any bound could bite. On an
    unauthenticated endpoint that is the whole of the cost a stranger
    controls, which is why it is asserted rather than reasoned about.

    The threshold is what the claim is. A peak under a hundredth of the
    input is far above what the walk actually costs (tens of kilobytes:
    a slice of the budget, its escaping, and the join) and far below
    what building the field would (the field itself), so it tells the
    two apart with room for an unrelated allocation on the same lines
    and no room at all for a regression to the old shape.

    Measured around the serializer alone, deliberately. Reading and
    parsing the request IS the body's size and always was; what this
    pins is that nothing downstream of the parse adds a second copy.
