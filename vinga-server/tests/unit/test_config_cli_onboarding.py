"""The onboarding command: `config ota-url`.

It stands outside the configuration API, so it is driven through
`cli.main()` like every other command but meets nothing on the other
side, which is most of what is asserted about it: no socket, no
database, no token, and a URL equal to the one a server built from the
same file would serve.

What answers on that URL is `vinga-server doctor`, a command of its own
since #244 and a suite of its own in `test_doctor.py`. What the two
still share is the derivation, which lives in `onboarding.origin`; the
assertion here that a printed URL is one a real application answers on
is what keeps this half of it honest.
