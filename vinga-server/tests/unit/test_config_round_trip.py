"""The writable round trip: a read of an entity is a write of it.

The contract #192 states is that the `entity` half of a read is
resubmittable as it stands. Here it is executable: every commanded kind
is written from its own example fragment, read back, and the read is
PUT again unchanged, and the second read is the first one byte for byte.

The hard case is the mask. A read masks whatever sits under a
secret-shaped key, and not every masked value is ciphertext: a lowercase
environment name in an `*_env` option and a whitespace-padded `$VAR` in
an MCP server's env are both values a write accepts and the display
rule refuses to show, so a read of such an entity carries `********`
where a value it holds is stored. The unchanged-value marker is what
makes that read writable: resubmitting the mask means keep what is
stored there, and a mask with nothing stored behind it is refused
naming as much of the path as this repository may name.

So the masked cases here start from writes the API itself accepted,
which is what an engine-planted row cannot stand in for, and the
sentinel runs on both paths: the value the marker substitutes is a
planted credential, and it must appear in no response, no refusal, no
log record in either format, and on no exception the repository raises.
