"""What a provider type declares it accepts, and the refusal it gives.

Every case here runs in the ordinary lane. That is deliberate and it is
the review round's finding: the default install carries no optional
extras, so a suite that reached the faster-whisper engine would be
skipped in CI, and the contract these cases hold is not the engine's. It
is the model's, the sanitizer's and the registry's dispatch, none of
which needs a model file to be true. The engine plumbing stays in
`test_providers_faster_whisper.py` under its own guard.

Three things are pinned here.

Coercion parity, because every converted type had a hand-written reader
before it had a model, and a rewrite that quietly widened what a
deployment may write would be a compatibility change nobody decided on.
The tables below are those readers' accepted-and-rejected sets, call by
call, one per type.

The refusal's shape, because naming the field is the whole point of the
issue and naming anything else is the thing this repository does not do:
the pointers are asserted exactly, and a credential planted in a key and
in a value is looked for through the whole exception chain.

And the dispatch, because a partially converted registry has two factory
shapes and the table decides which one a type gets.
