"""The `.env` file, read before anything looks at the environment.

Both spellings read one, because both have to behave identically and
the console script never reaches `vinga-server.main`. It is the second
file this process opens on a path nobody validated, and it is the one
most likely to hold credentials: what a `.env` carries is exactly the
variables the API token and the provider keys come from.

So what is held here is that it is read behind the refusal boundary and
not in front of it. A `.env` that will not open leaves as one fixed
sentence; a `.env` that will not decode leaves as the same one, and the
exception that carried its bytes is not on the chain of what leaves.
The sentinels are the values a real `.env` would hold, an address and a
credential, and both are checked on every surface a value can come out
on: the two streams, the log records made while the case ran, and the
exception the refusal is carried by, chain included.
