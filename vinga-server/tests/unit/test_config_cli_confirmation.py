"""The confirmation a destructive verb asks, and the flags around it.

Three things are held here, and they are three because each of them
fails a different way.

**Which verbs are destructive** is a fact on the registration table, and
a test that derived the expected set from that same fact would pass on a
`delete` row accidentally marked false: the row would leave the
implementation and the expectation together. So the intended set is
written out below as a closed semantic list and compared against the
table in BOTH directions. The one derivation kept is from the descriptor
registry rather than from the flag, so a new deletable kind joins both
sides at once.

**When it asks** is the whole precedence matrix, every row a case: both
flags, both TTY states, and the three positions a flag can be given in.
The asymmetry worth naming rather than smoothing is that `--no-input`
refuses a destructive verb and does not refuse a secret write: a
confirmation has no other way to be answered, while a secret has three
doors and disabling one leaves two.

**What it says** is three fixed constants carrying no address and no
other value from the command line, and the sentinels for that are
exhaustive rather than representative: every identity segment a
destructive command takes carries a DISTINCT credential-shaped value,
one per field, so a leak names its own source, and absence is asserted
on all four surfaces a value can come out on.
