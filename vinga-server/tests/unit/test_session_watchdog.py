"""The first-token watchdog on the LLM round.

A provider that stalls before its first token used to freeze the
pipeline for as long as it cared to take: nothing bounded the gap
between sending the request and the first byte of the answer, so a 17 s
stall held the session in replying, deaf to a user who politely waits,
until a barge-in rescued it (#68). The watchdog bounds only that gap:
one timeout cancels the request and retries the round once, a second
gives the round up, and a generation that is already streaming is never
touched, however long it runs.

What a given-up round costs the user is the last case in the file. It
was a silent turn, which is what the middle cases still drive, on a
world with no failure phrase cached; a served world has one, and the
turn says so out loud instead (#384).

These tests drive the reply directly against an LLM whose first-token
delay is written down per call, with the timeout shrunk to test scale.
