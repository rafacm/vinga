"""The conversation store over HTTP: three reads on the gated /api.

Two seams, deliberately. One test holds a real conversation against a
booted server and then asks that same server's API what it recorded,
which is the only place the whole path is provable: the pipeline
assembles a turn, the writer commits it, and the routes serve it. The
rest write the store directly, because a page boundary, a cursor past
the end and a text-off row are properties of the reads, and driving
each of them through a websocket would be a slower test of the same
thing.

What the file is about, beyond the round trip:

- **The cursors are the row ids and the pages are exact.** A page walked
  to the end recovers the whole listing in order, once, and
  `next_cursor` is null exactly when there is nothing beyond it.
- **Nothing a caller sends is quoted back.** A limit, a cursor, a device
  filter and a session id are the only values these routes are handed,
  and a sentinel planted in each is hunted through the response body,
  both shipped log formats and the process output.
- **A missing file is a 404 naming the switch, and never a new file.**
  A read of a deployment that never recorded creates nothing, which is
  what keeps an absent section a server that leaves no database behind.
