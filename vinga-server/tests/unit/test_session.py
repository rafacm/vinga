"""The websocket session, driven the way the firmware drives it.

The client side here plays the device: same headers as `Ota::SetupHttp`
sets, same hello as `WebsocketProtocol::OpenAudioChannel` sends, and the
same Opus codec the server uses, running the client's leg of the audio.
The pipeline behind the session is the mock providers: the ASR answers
a configured transcript (`{ms}` becomes the utterance duration), the
LLM replies "You said <transcript>.", and the TTS speaks a tone whose
length follows the text.
