"""The `vinga-server doctor` command: what answers on an OTA URL.

Driven through `doctor.main()`, which since #244 is the whole entry
point of a command of its own; the tests at the foot of this file are
what pin the word that reaches it. On the other side it meets a canned
endpoint behind this module's client seam, plus one case against the
real describe handler so that a change to what that handler prints
cannot pass unnoticed.

The hostile cases are the other half. What this command reaches may be a
proxy, a captive portal or anything else that answers, so its body, the
URL it names and the version it claims are text nobody vouched for, and
the sentinel assertions here are the M1 round's no-leak discipline
applied to a reader that did not exist then: a terminal. A URL an
operator typed is the same kind of text from the other direction, since
it may be the deployment's own secret `ota_path`, and that is why the
usage errors and the entry point's own refusals are asserted to repeat
nothing of what was typed.

The environment fixture and the vectors below are this file's own copy
of the `ota-url` suite's, duplicated rather than shared when the two
commands came apart: they are a handful of lines, and a support module
holding them would be a name nobody could place for two suites that no
longer share a command.
