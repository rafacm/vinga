"""What the CLI prints from an answer, and what it refuses to print.

Five commands ask the running server rather than the database: `device
pending list` lists the boards waiting to be claimed, `status` says what
each MCP server is doing, `apply` installs a changed registry and says
what it did, `agent preview` assembles an agent's prompt block by block,
and `diff` says what the store holds that the server is not serving.
None of them writes anything, and all five are rendered rather than
relayed, so this is where the rendering rules live.

Since #139 the shape of an answer is the pydantic model `api.py`
declares it answers with, read in strict mode, unknown fields dropped
and nothing coerced. What that buys is what these tests are mostly
about: a body this client cannot recognize did not come from this API's
sanitized output, and what a proxy or a captive portal returns is text
nobody vouched for, so it meets one fixed sentence and reaches neither
stream nor the exception chain under it. Each parametrized case is the
valid body with a single field replaced by a value shaped like a pasted
credential, and the control beside it is the valid body itself, which is
what makes the refusals about the replacement.

The renderers themselves are the other half: the states an operator has
never met before, the order two names are listed in, the block a
prompt's reader came to see whole, and the escape sequence that must not
reach the terminal on any of them.
