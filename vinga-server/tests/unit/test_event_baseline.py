"""The record baseline, and the obligation that makes it a proof.

The harness in `tests/tools/event_baseline.py` drives every emit path
and captures what it produced. On its own that would prove only what it
happened to execute, which is exactly the hole a runtime harness falls
into. So the completeness claim comes from outside it: from the catalog.

Every variant the catalog declares has to be produced by some driver's
run. Every legal variant is constructible, and therefore directly
drivable, so a declaration nothing can produce is a permanent
enlargement of what this server may say. That is what the plan means by
claiming exhaustiveness over variants rather than over call sites, and
it is what the static walk this file used to carry was standing in for
while an untyped emit site was invisible to anything but a reading of
the source. The walk retired with the last conversion.

A variant is identified by its event, channel, level and template AND by
its payload's keys, because an event can say one sentence about
several shapes: `tool_call` reports a builtin, a server tool and a call
it may not name at all with the same words, and the four dimensions
alone would let any of the three stand in for the others.

Beside it, the smaller claim the drivers can give themselves: each one
produces the event it says it does, so a driver whose path stopped
firing fails rather than quietly recording a neighbour's records.

All of it holds before a conversion and after it, which is the point:
the committed capture is a file that does not move when the sites do.
