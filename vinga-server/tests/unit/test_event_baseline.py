"""Every emit path, held to what the catalog declares about it.

The harness in `tests/tools/event_baseline.py` drives every emit path
and captures what it produced. On its own that would prove only what it
happened to execute, which is exactly the hole a runtime harness falls
into. So the completeness claim comes from outside it: from the catalog.

Every variant the catalog declares has to be produced by some driver's
run. Every legal variant is constructible, and therefore directly
drivable, so a declaration nothing can produce is a permanent
enlargement of what this server may say. That is what the plan means by
claiming exhaustiveness over variants rather than over call sites, and
it is what the static walk this file used to carry was standing in for
while an untyped emit site was invisible to anything but a reading of
the source. The walk retired with the last conversion.

A variant is identified by its event, channel, level and template AND by
its payload's keys, because an event can say one sentence about
several shapes: `tool_call` reports a builtin, a server tool and a call
it may not name at all with the same words, and the four dimensions
alone would let any of the three stand in for the others.

Beside it, the smaller claim the drivers can give themselves: each one
produces the event it says it does, so a driver whose path stopped
firing fails rather than quietly recording a neighbour's records.

There is no committed capture any more (#241). A file of eighty-six
recorded shapes was a third pin on a catalog `docs/reference/events.md`
already pins, and every event change cost a regeneration of it. What it
uniquely held is here instead, live and needing nothing on disk: every
produced record conforms to a variant its event declares, and `CARRIED`
below holds each PATH to the shape it is supposed to produce, which is
the pair of things no declaration can state: which of an event's
same-shaped variants this path emits, and which of that variant's
optional fields it fills.

Nothing here reports a payload value. The drivers work from real
material, a planted API token among it, so a red lane says channel,
level, template, field names and type names and stops there; the
builtins check below is the model, and it names the offending TYPE.

# that event may take and never which one this path is supposed to
# produce. Four events declare siblings whose payload keys are identical
# and whose sentences are not: `barge_in_suppressed` has three,

# fields are optional per emission: `llm_round` names the configured
# entry behind a provider the registry built and says nothing about one

# changing what a path produces, the same way the reference is
# regenerated when a variant's fields move. A driver added without a row
# here fails the check below rather than being silently uncovered.
