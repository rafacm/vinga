"""What a refused emission is allowed to say about itself.

A value type reads what it is handed, and a machine that reads values is
a machine that can repeat them. That is the failure this suite exists to
refuse: the whole point of #155 is keeping far-side bytes off the
retained log, and a refusal that quoted the value it rejected would put
them there through the door it was built to close.

So the diagnostics render catalog-owned identifiers only: a fixed label,
a fixed violation code, and on a value type's own refusal the type and
the constraint it failed. Nothing else, on any surface. A
credential-shaped sentinel therefore goes through every distinct refusal
branch and is hunted in every place a value could surface: the report's
sentence and its arguments, both shipped log formats, `Emission.args`,
an attached tap, and a capture's decision track. The report's `msg` and
`args` are asserted by EQUALITY rather than by substring absence,
because a substring hunt proves only that this spelling did not appear.

A refused emission is DROPPED, after that one report. There is no
substitute to inspect, so the other half of every test here is that
nothing at all was dispatched: no tap saw an emission, no capture wrote
one, and `emit` returned the way it returns for an event that worked.

The sentinel is shaped so that it satisfies no `ID` syntax and no token
set (the dots see to that) while still being an ordinary printable
string, which is what lets one spelling drive every branch.

Descriptors are the other half, and their model has two classes rather
than one, because a lawful descriptor necessarily reaches the argument
positions that render it: an ADMISSIBLE credential-shaped value appears
in exactly its declared field and argument position on every intended
consumer and nowhere else, and a REJECTED one appears nowhere at all.
The bound is the value type's, applied again at construction whatever
the decision site did, which is what the four sanitization sites next
door are held to from the other end.
