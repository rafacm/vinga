"""Shared prompt fragments, and the lists that include them.

The section itself is small: a name, and a block of text promised
verbatim. What this file mostly pins is the discipline around it. A
fragment name and an include are written beside prompt text, which is
where an operator pastes things, so neither a bad name nor an
unresolved include is ever repeated back: the refusals name the
section, the layer, the position and the rule, and the sentinel below
is looked for in the whole exception chain, since a message built
inside an exception handler drags the rejected input along behind it.
