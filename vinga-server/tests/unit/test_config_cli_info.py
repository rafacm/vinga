"""`vinga info`: what it prints, and what it must never print anywhere
else.

The command answers one question, "what server am I talking to", and it
answers it from three places at once: what this CLI knows before it
asks (the address it is about to contact), what the running server
answers (its build, and the URL a board is onboarded at), and what the
store holds (how much of each kind). Two acts and a preamble, so the
first half of this file is about the composition and the order.

The second half is about the one value in it that is a credential. The
onboarding URL's last segment is a key derived from the device-auth
secret and it stands in front of the token issuer, which is why the
startup banner deliberately prints the origin without it. Serving it
over an authenticated read is this issue's decision and the second
recorded exception to the cli-guide's "a credential never travels in a
read"; what makes the exception safe is a list of places the value must
not reach, and a list is worth nothing unless something checks it.

So the sentinel is the real thing. The URL is derived here by calling
`onboarding.origin.onboarding_url` with a device-auth secret in the
environment, exactly as a deployment's composition root does, and every
case below hunts for the whole URL and for its key segment on its own:
on stderr, in the refusals, in the log records of the whole invocation
rendered both ways a deployment keeps them, and along the exception
chain a failure leaves behind.
