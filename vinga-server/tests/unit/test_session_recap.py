"""Offering a recap of a long thread, and what happens once one is
consented to.

The flow this file is about has one property everything else follows
from: **what the user hears is what the store keeps, and the store keeps
it only after they have heard it.** So the recap is spoken by the
runtime rather than handed back to a model to rephrase, and the
checkpoint is enqueued after the audio has gone out, which means a
barge-in, a voice that failed, a device that left and a database that
refused all leave the thread exactly as it was.

Driven as whole replies rather than through `run_reply`, and that is the
one thing that makes these assertions possible: the reply's own speaking
path is what carries the recap, so a suite that stubbed it would be
asserting about a promise it had removed. The voice is a double that
records what it was asked to say and says when it finished saying it,
and the store double snapshots that at the moment it is handed a
checkpoint.

The model is one `ScriptedLlm` across three rounds, because that is what
a consent reply really is: the round that calls the tool, the
summarization round the runtime runs against the same provider, and the
round seeded on the other side of the move.
