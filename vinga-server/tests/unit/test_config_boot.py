"""The domain-half re-read a running server does on request.

`reload_domain_config` is the boot's own steps 2 to 5 with step 1 left
out, so what these check is exactly that: the stored half is fresh, the
file half is the running process's own, and every refusal the boot can
meet is met here too, because it is the same code meeting it.
