"""What a typed event's vocabulary admits, and what it says when it
refuses.

Two claims, and the second is the one that matters more. The first is
ordinary: each value type accepts what its kind describes and refuses
what it does not, at construction rather than at emit, so a site that
holds one has already proved it. The second is the no-leak claim these
types inherit from the emitter's refusal report: the value handed to a
refusing constructor is precisely what may not reach a log, a lane's
stderr or an exception chain, so a credential-shaped sentinel goes
through every refusing branch and is hunted in the exception's `str`,
its `repr` and its `args`.

Asserted by absence AND by equality where the shape allows it, for the
reason the sentinel suite gives: a substring hunt proves only that this
spelling did not appear.
