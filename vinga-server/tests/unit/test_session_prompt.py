"""What the running session sends as the system prompt, and when.

The assembler itself is `test_runtime_prompt.py`; what this file is
about is the two clocks. The know-how half (the persona, the fragments
the agent includes and the guidance of the entries it is granted) is
assembled once per
activation and cached, so a reply never rebuilds it and an agent switch
always does. The memory blocks keep the clock the first of them has
always had, read per round, and moved off the event loop rather than
moved in time; the ledger a conversation keeps is read on that same
clock, so what one round wrote down is what the next round is sent.
