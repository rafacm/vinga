"""The durable half of a marker: what it retries, what it answers, and
what it says about a hole it could not avoid.

Driven through the store's own seams, like the suite next door: the gate
is where the writer parks, so an interleaving is arranged rather than
waited for, and the engine is replaced with one that refuses chosen
transactions, because nothing a producer can do makes a committed
database fail on the next statement.

Three properties, and each is provable only here:

- **A turn's acknowledgement speaks for that turn.** True when its
  durable transaction commits, false when the turn was dropped, and
  false rather than pending once the writer is gone.
- **The two halves of a marker have independent fates.** An events
  transaction that fails takes no turn with it, and the turns of the
  same marker are in the database when it does.
- **A dropped batch leaves a mark on the thread rather than only in a
  counter.** `conversations.incomplete` is product state, outside the
  telemetry switch, latched in memory until a transaction lands it, set
  from the first byte of a row that materializes after the loss, and
  true by the time the next turn of that thread is acknowledged.

The last section is the recap checkpoint, which is on this path for the
same three reasons and is the one record whose handle a caller really
waits on.
