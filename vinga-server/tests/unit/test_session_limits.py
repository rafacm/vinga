"""The two bounds on how long one session lives, and the polite close.

`max_session_s` caps a session's total life. `idle_timeout_s` is the
shorter one users actually meet: a realtime device streams its mic
continuously and nothing in the firmware ever closes the channel, so
walking away used to leave a mic running until the hour was up (#20).
Both end the same way, and the firmware reads the close as the end of a
conversation and reconnects on the next wake word, so both are invisible
in normal use.

request_shutdown is the shared way to end a session politely, used by
the cap, the idle timeout, and the shutdown drain alike: a reply already
speaking finishes its sentence first, because somebody is listening
to it.
