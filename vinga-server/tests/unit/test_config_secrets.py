"""The stored-secret envelope: round trips, rotation, and every refusal.

The refusals are the point of most of this file. A secret that cannot
be read has to say which entity and slot it belongs to, so the operator
knows what to set again, and it has to say that without carrying the
value anywhere a log or a bug report would pick it up: not in the
message, and not in the exception chain either.
