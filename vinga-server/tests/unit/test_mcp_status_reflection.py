"""A credential an MCP server reflects back must not reach an operator
surface.

The status surface is a gated read, and the whole API refuses to read a
stored secret back. An MCP server holds one: whatever this deployment
configured for it in `env:` or `headers:`. It also chooses every byte of
what it publishes, so a careless or hostile one can put that credential
in a tool description, in an argument's description, or in the name it
lists. Carrying tool metadata through would therefore have made the
status read exactly the readback path the rest of the API is careful not
to be.

Both transports get a server that does it, over a real connection: a
subprocess for stdio, an in-process uvicorn for HTTP. Each asserts the
value reaches none of the three surfaces it could have: the status
response, the `config mcp-server status` output, and the log.

What does cross, deliberately, is a name that publishes: the model has
to be given it and an operator has to be able to write it down, and the
connect log has always printed it under the same publishing rule. So the
servers here reflect the credential in everything else, including the
name of a tool listed too long to publish, and the tests assert that the
names which do publish arrive.
