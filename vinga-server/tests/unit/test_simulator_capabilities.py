"""The honest capability statement, held to being one.

The decision behind this table is that the help says what the simulator
supports AND what it does not, both directions, so that nobody debugs a
deployment believing it is a board. A paragraph cannot be held to that.
Five assertions can, and each of them is held to going red here, because
an assertion that something is complete is exactly the shape that keeps
passing after the thing under it stops working.

The fifth is the one this milestone exists for. Every merge is
releasable and the image publishes on it, so a table advertising the
conversation before the verb that holds one has landed would be help
that lies for the length of a milestone. A supported row must name a
verb the registered tree HAS; a not-available-yet row must name one it
does NOT.
