"""The holder every convergence point reads, and the mark that says
whether it is holding still.

Three properties and nothing else, because the holder is three
sentences: what `current()` answers is the object that was installed and
not a copy of it, the settled mark advances once per apply whatever
happened inside, and the mark reads as nothing at all while an apply is
changing serving state. The last one is the whole reason the mark is not
a bare counter: an apply changes more than one thing, and a reader that
sampled a counter either side of an await would find it unmoved over a
window in which the world had already gone.
