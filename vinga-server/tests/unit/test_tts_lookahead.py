"""Synthesizing the next sentence while the current one is still playing.

A reply is spoken sentence by sentence and frames are paced to realtime,
so sending a sentence takes about as long as hearing it. Synthesizing
only once the previous sentence had finished playing therefore put the
next sentence's whole time to first byte on the speaker as silence, once
per sentence, for the whole reply: 617 ms and 520 ms between the
sentences of a three-sentence reply through `gpt-4o-mini-tts`, heard
from a board as "hiccups in the assistant's voice" (#37).

The provider here is slow on purpose, because that is the condition the
defect needs. The central assertion is an ordering rather than a
duration: a sentence's synthesis must begin before that sentence starts
being spoken, which is precisely the inversion the fix makes. Under the
old code `_speak` sent `sentence_start` and only then called the
provider, so it could not have been true of any sentence.
