"""The memory store: what it keeps, what it drops, and how it fails.

The schema's own suite next door is about the chain (the head, the
identity column, the indexes, the checks, the advisory key). This one is
about the sentences a caller speaks, and about the properties they are
held to: a fact survives the process that stored it, the caps are
applied inside the write transaction rather than beside it, two writers
through independent connections cannot lose each other's fact, an id
reaches only what its owner may reach, a held fact is outside every cap
and still there to be brought back, and a database that refuses answers
with a fixed sentence rather than with the connection string it tried.

Every fixed sentence is compared by equality against the module's own
constant rather than searched for as a substring, which is what keeps a
refusal a contract instead of a phrase that happens to appear.

Nothing here reaches into the store for an engine. What it drives is the
store's own calls and the stores `tests/support/stores.py` builds
through the same public constructor the opener uses; where a test has to
see the rows themselves, it opens its own connection, which is the point
of the independent-connection assertions below.
