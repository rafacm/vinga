"""Whether an agent may remember at all, and when the answer moves.

The section is `agents.<name>.memory`, in the `filler` mould: unset
inherits, naming one replaces it wholly, and `memory: {enabled: false}`
opts an agent out. What it decides is two things nothing used to
decide, and this suite is written around the two of them being one
answer:

- the tools the agent is offered, and refused again if it asks for one
  anyway;
- the scope blocks its prompt carries, its board's included, and the
  round trip that reads them.

The clock is the third subject. The tools are snapshotted per reply and
the blocks are assembled per round, so the policy is resolved once, on
the line the snapshot is taken on, and both halves read that one
answer. A reload landing between two rounds of one reply is the case
that says whether it is true, and the two interleavings below force it
rather than reason about it.

Sibling agents on one board are how the "whole" in "off is whole" is
proven: what one agent may not read is exactly what the one beside it
still is.
