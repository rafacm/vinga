"""The write routes, over real HTTP.

Every write the CLI can make is reachable here, answering with what it
did and when it applies, and refusing with the repository's own
sentences under the status codes the plan fixes. The repository decides
everything; what is checked here is that the transport carries the
decision faithfully and adds nothing.

The other property is that nothing leaks, and a write is where that is
hardest: the body is the one place a credential legitimately travels,
and a rejected body is exactly the one a mistake put a credential into.
So every malformed-body path is driven with a sentinel value, and the
sentinel is looked for in the response, in its headers and in every
captured log record.
