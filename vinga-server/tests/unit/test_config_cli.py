"""The config command group, driven through its entry function.

This is the acceptance spine: the commands are the ones an operator
types, parsed by the real grammar, sent as real HTTP requests to the
real sub-application, handled by the real repository against a scratch
database. What replaces the socket is the client factory: Starlette's
TestClient is itself a synchronous `httpx.Client` subclass driving an
ASGI application through its own portal, so `cli.main()` stays the
unchanged synchronous entry point and nothing bridges an event loop.

The first test is the acceptance case: an empty database becomes a
working configuration through CLI calls alone, in the natural order,
with nothing wedging on the way. The rest is what has to hold around it,
one entity kind at a time: what a write is answered with, what a read
shows, what a delete refuses when something else names what it would
remove, and no failure path that lets a plaintext, a rejected fragment
or a traceback out. That per-kind behavior is what #139 made
descriptor-driven, and this file is where the claim that all five kinds
behave alike is kept.

Four neighbours hold the rest of the surface, split off by #139 along
the boundaries the production split produced, each named for the concern
it keeps: `test_config_cli_transport.py` (where a command is sent and
what it will not be sent over), `test_config_cli_rendering.py` (the four
answers the running server is asked for), `test_config_cli_secrets.py`
(a credential's whole life) and `test_config_cli_grammar.py` (the parse
and its exit codes).

# is a row that goes untested, and a test that skips itself on the
# machine that runs it proves nothing on any other. What is asserted is
# the whole of what an operator gets, so a row deleted from the
# production table, or one left to fall through to the general sentence,
# is a failure here rather than a silence.
#
# Every injected exception carries the sentinel where the real one
# carries a value: an `OSError`'s `filename`, a decode error's buffer.
# The two real-filesystem cases below the table are what says the
