    entries of a type left the operator to work out which.

    What the library said is deliberately not repeated. This message is

    is a boot failure and the entry point answers one with a single line,

    while being handed this entry's options: an SDK that cannot reach its
    endpoint quotes the URL, one that will not authenticate quotes what
    it was given. So the class name is said and nothing else is: not the
    message, and not the exception either.
