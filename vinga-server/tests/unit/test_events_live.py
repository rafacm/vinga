"""The subscriber hub: what a reader is handed, and what it costs to
hand it.

The suite next door (`test_events.py`) proves the dispatch machinery
this attaches to. What is proved here is the hub's own four promises:

- it hears both channels, the session's and the server's, and hands one
  reader what its filters admit and nothing else;
- `emit` never waits on a reader, proved from a foreign thread with the
  loop parked, which is the shape the conversation store's writer
  thread really emits in;
- a reader that falls behind loses the oldest events and is told how
  many, in its own stream, so silence never means loss;
- everything ends: unsubscribing detaches, and a close wakes every
  reader and terminates it, which is what keeps a shutdown from waiting
  on an open tail.

And the no-leak pin, which is the reason this surface can exist at all:
what a reader receives is the record the log retains plus the stream's
own two fields, asserted as an equality rather than as a scan for
sentinels.

Emissions are constructed directly where the property under test is the
hub's own, since `Emission` is the tap contract's vocabulary; the
channel and no-leak tests go through the real emitters and the real
catalog, because what they claim is about production events.
