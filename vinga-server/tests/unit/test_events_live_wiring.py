"""The live hub at the device edge: when it attaches, and when it lets
go.

A session publishes no event accessor, so the hub cannot find its own
way in: the composition root hands it to `ws.py`, which hands it to
`DeviceSession`, which attaches it to the events object it has just
built. The attach point is the subject of this file, because it is the
whole reason the wiring exists at all. Every refusal a session can
answer with happens before the hello, and the conversation store's tap
attaches after it: a hub attached where the store's tap attaches would
miss exactly the lines an operator opens a tail to watch.

The other half is the letting go. A tap left on a session that has
ended is a consumer being written to for a conversation that is over,
so it comes off in an outer `finally` over the whole of `run`, and on
the one branch where a session that was built never runs at all: the
capacity rejection in `ws.py`, between construction and `run`.
