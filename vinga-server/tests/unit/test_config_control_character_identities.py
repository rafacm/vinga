"""What a refusal says of a control character written before the rule
(#414).

`store._check_addressable` refuses a control character in a name and
says why in as many words: it "does not survive a header or a log line
intact". It refuses it at WRITE time only, and the same docstring says
what that leaves: a row written before the rule "still boots, still
appears in a whole-configuration read, and is still deletable". So the
byte reached every sentence composed over a stored identity, and a
sentence is read on a server's stderr as it fails to start, where
nothing between the composition and the stream escapes anything.

The rows here are planted rather than written, because the write path
refuses them, exactly as the URL-credential suite beside this one plants
its own. What the two suites share is the door: `spoken_identity` is the
credential strip and the escape together, and the surfaces that read it
are the ones #381, #382 and #413 established.

Where this rule stops is measured rather than asserted by taste, and the
last section is that measurement. A view hands an identity back as a
document key, and every writer of that document escapes a control
character already and losslessly: JSON as a `\\u001b`, YAML as a `\\e`,
the CLI's terminal door as a `?`. Escaping there would mangle rather
than render, because a read is a fragment a write of it accepts back: an
export naming `bad\\x1bname` imports as a lawful eleven-character agent
that nothing meant, where today the same export is refused by the rule
that says what a name may hold.

    mark, driven end to end rather than argued.

    A control character percent-encodes losslessly, so unlike a
    credential-bearing name this row can be fetched, renamed and deleted
    over the API. The escaped spelling is what tells an operator which
    byte to encode; a fixed mark would name the row without saying what
    is in it, and would print two different broken names alike.

    The delete is of the planted row ITSELF rather than of the lawful
    name a rename just gave it, which is what the sol round on PR #423
    caught: a delete goes by membership, so the row that is deletable is
    the one no write would accept, and renaming first is the one route
    that never asks the delete to say the name.
