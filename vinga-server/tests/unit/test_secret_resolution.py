"""Stored secrets at the point of use, against real providers and a
real MCP server.

Round-tripping an envelope proves the cryptography; it does not prove
that a credential written with `a noun's own `secret set`` reaches the client
that has to send it. So these build the providers the registry builds
and spawn the stdio server the MCP tests spawn, and then look at where
the plaintext ended up: in the client and in the child process's
environment, and in no model, log record or error message.
