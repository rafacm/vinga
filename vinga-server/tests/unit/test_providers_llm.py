    a body could hold anything and still parse. Under #88 that type is
    the escape hatch, which is the recorded reason the fixture needed no
    compatibility decision: the same body parses, and its four unread
    keys stop being inert.

    "Stop being inert" is a claim about the request, so it is asserted
    against the request. The bodies suite says those keys survive
    validation as `model_extra`, and a builder that dropped, renamed or
    filtered any of them would pass that and fail this. Keys AND values,
    since forwarding a key with the wrong value under it is the same
    silence in a different shape, and `null` under `connection.timeout_s`
    is the one an `exclude_unset` reflex would eat.
