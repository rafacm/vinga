"""What this deployment remembers, over the gated /api.

Two seams, the shape `test_conversations_api.py` settled on. One test
holds a booted server against its own API: the server opens memory, an
agent is told something through the store that server opened, and the
same server's routes answer with it. Everything else writes through the
store directly, because a page boundary, a cursor past the end and an
ownership negative are properties of the routes and driving each of them
through a whole server would be a slower test of the same thing.

What the file is about, beyond the round trip:

- **The cursors are exact, on all four listings.** Three of them walk
  owner names and one walks the fact ids, and each is asked at the
  boundary (a page that ends the listing exactly says there is no more)
  and past it (a walk recovers the whole listing once, in order).
- **An owner with no rows is an empty shape.** Never a 404: an agent
  that has been told nothing, a board nobody noted anything about and a
  name that was never anybody's all read the same way, which is the
  #283 contract applied to the third schema.
- **Nothing a caller sends is quoted back.** A fact's text, a ledger
  key, a limit, a cursor and an owner name are the values these routes
  are handed, and a sentinel planted in each is hunted through the
  response body, both shipped log formats and the process output.
- **Neither the text of a fact nor the name of an entry rides a URL.**
  Both travel in a body, so the request target a proxy would log carries
  neither. Asserted on the requests themselves.
- **A correction is held to the cap invariant and to ownership.** An
  oversized correction is refused, a correction that grows a fact
  re-prunes the scope, and a number under the wrong owner reaches
  nothing and is answered by the one fixed sentence.
