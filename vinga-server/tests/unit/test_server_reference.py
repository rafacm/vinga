"""The generated server-half reference, and the selector that prints it.

The page is rendered from `ServerConfig`, so what is worth pinning is
everything a byte-for-byte diff of the committed copy cannot see: that
the page is complete against the models rather than merely equal to
itself, that every rule the server enforces is stated where an operator
meets the key it is about, and that rendering it still needs no
database, no configuration file and no key.

Completeness is checked per section rather than page-wide, which is the
one thing this suite does differently from the domain one. The server
models repeat `enabled`, `port` and `max_session_s` across sections, so
a row found somewhere on the page says nothing about the section it was
supposed to be in, and a whole missing section could hide behind another
section's rows.
