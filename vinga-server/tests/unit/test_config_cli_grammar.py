"""The grammar itself: what it accepts, what it says, and how it exits.

Every other config suite drives a command that parses. This one is about
the parse: a subcommand nobody has, a missing positional, an unknown
flag, an argument too many, a bare invocation that named no command at
all, a word the grammar used to have, and `--help`, which is the one
invocation that is not a failure.

The exit code is the contract under all of it. Click's own error path
prints the mistake and exits 2, which would make a typed command the
single failure that bypasses both the documented codes and the sanitized
boundary, so the group runs Click with that path off and answers every
usage error itself, exiting 1 like everything else. And a refusal must
never echo what was typed: Click quotes an unknown command, repeats a
bad value and offers a did-you-mean built from an unknown option, and
the mistake all of that covers is typing the secret after the slot.

The two help-text assertions are here because the help is part of the
grammar rather than a rendering of an answer. Each pins a phrase an
operator looks for in the place they look first: the state a `status`
can report that they have never met before, and which of the two ways to
bind a board takes a MAC and which takes an activation code.

# three, and `ota-url` and `check` reach no API at all, so each takes

# the file half names the way a boot reads it.
