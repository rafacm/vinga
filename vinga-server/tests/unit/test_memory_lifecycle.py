"""A conversation's memory shares its thread's lifecycle.

The two stores are two schemas in one database, and #83 makes that a
promise rather than a coincidence: when a thread is erased or pruned,
what the conversation was keeping and the facts it forgot go in the same
transaction as its turns. This suite is about that transaction and about
the order everything else is held in around it.

What it pins:

- **Atomicity, from both sides.** A deletion answers counts for the
  memory it took, and a deletion that does not commit leaves every one
  of those rows exactly where it was.
- **The lock order.** A transaction that writes both stores takes the
  record chain's advisory lock and then the memory chain's, ascending,
  which is what keeps two of them from deadlocking. Asserted by
  recording the keys as they are taken, walking the erasure path, the
  retention path and the agent rename that takes all three, because a
  lock order is not observable in any other way.
- **Both straddling interleavings, forced rather than reasoned about.**
  A thread-keyed memory write parked inside its transaction while a
  deletion arrives finishes first and is then deleted by that deletion;
  one that arrives while a deletion is inside its own transaction waits,
  meets the dead set, and is refused with the fixed sentence. The gate
  is an advisory lock this suite holds, so each interleaving is an
  arrangement and not a wait.
- **What is not a thread's is not taken.** An agent's facts survive the
  erasure of the conversation they were said in, and a `remember` in
  flight during a deletion is not held up by it: it takes one chain's
  lock and nothing else, because a fact about the user is nobody's
  thread.

Every thread here is minted per test, the way a session mints one: an id
a deletion has named is refused for the life of the process, which is
what the dead set is, and a suite that reused an id would be arranging
something no server can meet.
