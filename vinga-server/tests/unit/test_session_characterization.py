"""What a session does today, pinned from outside before it is split.

Issue #85 lifts the device-facing boundary out of `session.py`: the
edge (handshake, codecs, framing, pacing) on one side, the conversation
runtime (endpointing, gates, filler, ASR/LLM/TTS) on the other. The
move is meant to change nothing observable, and "nothing observable"
needs to be checkable rather than asserted in a pull request
description.

So these tests hold the properties the extraction is most able to break
and that no other test holds: the log channel every conversation record
is emitted on, the exact moment `speaking_started` is stamped and which
agent it names, the arbitration between a reply chunk too short to
produce a packet and a filler timer that has not fired, the discipline
that keeps the shared Opus encoder's feed order intact across a filler,
the control message order of one turn on the wire, the shutdown waiting
out a reply that is generating rather than speaking, and both halves of
the pair of exceptions that end a reply quietly.

They deliberately assert wire bytes, structured events, and log records
rather than internals, so that they keep their meaning once the code
they cover lives in two packages. Where they must drive the reply, they
go through `drive_reply` and `start_reply`, which name that entry point
in one place.
