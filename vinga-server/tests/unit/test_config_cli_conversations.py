"""The `conversation` noun: three verbs over the API, and what they
print.

The store's other projection in front of an operator, driven the way
`session` is next door: requests through the client seam, against a
server built per command, with the record seeded by the real writer.
There is no local-database path here and there is not going to be one
(#281, #282).

What this file exists for beyond the round trips is the part the session
verbs did not have to answer. A session row is short values a server
minted; a thread's title and its dialogue are what a room said into a
microphone, so this is the surface where printed content really is
content:

- **Content cannot steer a terminal.** Titles and dialogue go through
  the merged `printable` bounding, embedded newlines included, so the
  line structure of a listing and of a dialogue block is the renderer's
  alone. The tests plant escapes, control characters, tabs and newlines
  and compare both streams byte for byte.
- **A null title is the fixed placeholder.** A thread recorded under
  text-off has no name, which is an ordinary state rather than a
  rendering that failed.
- **`show` is one command and two reads.** The header comes from the
  detail and the dialogue from the timeline beside it, because a column
  holding an utterance is a column that wraps.
- **Only this API's own refusal is relayed.** These verbs print what a
  refusal said, so what answers has to be shown to be this API before
  its words reach a terminal: the media type, the shape, the status and
  the title all have to agree, and a body that fails any of them is the
  fixed sentence with nothing of itself in it.
