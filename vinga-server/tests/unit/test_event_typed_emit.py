"""What the emit path produces, and what its guard does.

Three claims. The first is what a constructed variant becomes: the
record a deployment keeps and the emission every tap is handed, on both
scopes, with the session emitter's own identity contributed inside the
guard beside the variant's own values.

The second is the construction guard's, and it needs its own pins
because no caller can prove it: a site hands the emitter a thunk and
never learns whether it ran. So both of its refusals (a thunk that
raised, a variant handed to an emitter on another channel) are driven,
and what a refusal does is asserted whole: one report on the emitter's
own channel, and the emission dropped rather than replaced.

The third is what happens when saying so is itself what breaks. Every
report this module makes is made from inside a guard, and a logging call
is not the inert operation it looks like: a handler, a filter and a
formatter are code somebody else installed, and the sharpest case is a
failing LOG tap reported back onto the same broken channel.

That every converted path still produces a record its declaration
describes is `test_event_baseline.py`'s claim, not this file's:
eighty-one paths driven, and each record matched against the variants of
its event.

What a refusal is allowed to SAY is the sentinel suite's, next door.
