"""A credential's whole life on this surface, and where it may appear.

A secret reaches the configuration by one of three doors, all of them
here: typed at a terminal, which is read without echo so it does not
land in the scrollback; piped on stdin; or named as an environment
variable the CLI reads for itself. It is never an argument, because an
argument is what a shell history keeps.

After that the rule is one rule: it goes in and it does not come back
out. `show` and `list` mask what is stored and mark the environment
reference the stored value displaces, rather than leaving the shadowing
silent. A fragment carrying an inline credential where a `$VAR` belongs
is refused without the refusal quoting it, at every depth an option can
nest to. Deleting the entity takes its secrets with it.

The key is the last quarter of it. `VINGA_MASTER_KEY` encrypts what is
stored, and the recovery case is deliberate: reading, deleting and
replacing all treat ciphertext as opaque, so only storing a new secret
needs a key at all, and the refusal when there is none names the
variable and never the material.

Every assertion looks for a sentinel shaped so a substring check for it
cannot match by accident, on both streams and in every log record.
