"""Recording a session to disk, and what makes a recording usable.

The point of a capture is alignment: without lining up what the
microphone heard against what the speaker was playing against what the
server decided, an echo-triggered barge-in cannot be told from a genuine
one, and that distinction is the whole question in #28. So the
assertions here are mostly about time: that a sample index means the
same instant in both channels, that an event's `t_ms` indexes into the
audio, and that a gap in one channel becomes silence rather than sliding
everything after it.
