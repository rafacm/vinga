"""What a server event may never say, whoever provoked it.

The sibling of `test_event_surface_pins.py`, which does this for the
session scope, and what is left of both after #210: the prose pins that
restated a template, an argument tuple and a field set are gone, because
a variant IS its declaration now and nothing is left for a call to
disagree with. What a record holds is `docs/reference/events.md`'s; that a
record really holds it is the driver suite's.

What no file but this one holds is the negative claim. A pin says the
sentence is what it is; it does not say the sentence is SAFE. Each case
below plants a credential-shaped sentinel where a stranger's bytes
really arrive, drives the production path that reports it, and hunts the
spelling in every place a value could surface: the rendered sentence,
the arguments behind it, the payload's fields, both shipped log formats,
and an attached consumer's own copy of all three.

Six paths, chosen because each is somewhere far-side bytes meet a
diagnostic:

- the onboarding banner, where this deployment's own key is what a URL
  would be built from;
- an onboarding path that missed, where two keys are in play: the
  server's, which a probe was fishing for, and the attempted one, which
  a near miss would turn into a hint at the real one;
- a capture's failed write and an unusable capture directory, where a
  bare `Exception` catch meets whatever the filesystem, the wave module
  or a JSON encoder raised, messages that carry the path they tripped on
  or the bytes they choked on;
- a refused handshake, where the Device-Id header is a string whoever
  opened the socket chose and can retry as fast as the socket opens;
- a filler voice that would not cache, where the catch is around a whole
  synthesis and an exception raised near a provider's response can carry
  a fragment of one.

The `Vandal` is the other half of the same claim, and it is about
consumers rather than records: `Emission.args` is deliberately not
copied for a tap, so an object passed as a `%` argument reaches every
consumer as the live object, its chain and everything the chain closes
over. It finds nothing to vandalize, which is the assertion.
