"""The `agent rename` verb, driven end to end through the registered
command.

The transaction is pinned against the repository
(`test_agent_rename.py`), the protocol that covers the writers still in
flight against the store (`test_agent_rename_in_flight.py`), and what
the route answers against the API (`test_config_api_writes.py`). What
is left is the half only this milestone has: the command an operator
types, the request it builds and the two lines it prints.

Three things are asserted here and nowhere else.

- **The request.** A POST to the rename route, the address in its path
  and the new name in a body carrying that one key. Recorded off the
  wire, because a body built from the wrong field would still print a
  plausible acknowledgement.
- **The rendering, one case per boundary arm.** The server's own
  sentence and this client's remedy under it, which is the pairing #386
  landed: the server states what is true of the write and the grammar
  that owns the verb names the command that crosses it. Driven against
  a real server per arm rather than against a planted body, so that the
  sentence and the advice are the ones a deployment actually pairs.
- **The refusals an operator meets at a terminal**, including the
  reachable no-leak case: a new name is caller text, it is typed at
  this verb, and it is echoed in no stream and no log record.
