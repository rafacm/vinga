"""What every respelled command did, pinned before its words moved.

The #223 re-cut turns the grammar around: `set provider llm claude`
becomes `provider set llm claude`, and twelve more rows move with it.
Nothing else is meant to change. That claim is worth exactly as much as
what checks it, and the characterization suites around this one check
behavior per command rather than the whole run, so a respelling that
quietly dropped a notice, reordered two streams or changed an exit code
could pass all of them.

So this is a differential. Every row whose words move is driven in one
fixed order against one store, and what each of them printed on stdout,
printed on stderr and exited with is recorded in the committed
transcript beside this file (`data/cli-respelling.txt`), with the store
read back at the end. The transcript was captured on the commit BEFORE
the rename, from the old spellings, and it does not move with them: the
command lines below are respelled and the transcript is not, which is
what makes "the respelling changed nothing" a test rather than a claim.

Capturing it is this same test with `VINGA_CAPTURE_RESPELLING=1` set,
so the fixture and the check are one piece of code rather than two that
happen to agree. Capturing it again after the rename would prove
nothing, so it is done once and the file is read in review rather than
trusted.

`RESPELLINGS` is the licensed difference. Some of what these commands
print quotes a command back at the operator: an export's header says how
to reproduce a deployment, its foot lists a `set-secret` per stored slot,
a read's secrets heading names the command that fills one, and a write's
acknowledgement is answered with the command that installs what was
stored. Those move with the grammar, deliberately, and the table below
is the complete list of the substitutions that licenses.

The last of them no longer moves with the grammar because the server
said it: #386 took the command out of the two notices that named one,
and #426 finished the move by having the CLI's own line REPLACE the
sentence wherever it knows the boundary set. So what an operator reads
under a write is one line from the side that can say the whole of it.
The command is still printed and still moves with the grammar; which
side prints it, and whether the server's sentence is printed at all, is
what changed, and the two entries below record the whole of it. It is
applied to the TRANSCRIPT before the
comparison, so a difference the table does not explain is a failure, and
the table itself is short enough to read.

Four entries are not the rename's, and each is labelled. #341 made
`apply` install what it wrote, which rewrote the header an export opens
with into the three steps a rebuild then took. #371 swapped the two
verbs (`apply` writes under the name `import`, `reload` installs under
the name `apply`), shrank the per-write notice to the one line an
operator acts on, and moved the export header's three steps onto the
new verbs. A transcript captured before either cannot say any of it,
and the differential is about behavior rather than about a paragraph,
so those changes are licensed here rather than left to falsify a
record. An entry added for any later change belongs in the same place
and with the same label: a substitution nobody can name a reason for is
what this table must never grow.
