"""The writer: what it commits, when, and what it refuses to say.

Everything here is driven through the store's own seams rather than
through timing, because every property under test is about ordering
between a session loop and a background thread and a sleep would pin
none of them. The gate below is the seam the writer parks on, so
"invisible before the marker" is asserted with the writer demonstrably
stopped in front of that marker rather than after a wait that happened
to be long enough.

The two guarantees worth stating out loud, since the tests below are
the only place they are provable:

- **A marker commits its own session and no other.** One queue carries
  every session, so the interleaved case is the one that would fail if
  the writer batched globally.
- **Nothing the store says carries what the store holds.** The last
  tests plant a credential-shaped sentinel in a row and in an exception
  message and hunt it through both shipped log formats, the event
  fields, an attached server tap and the process output.
