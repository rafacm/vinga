"""The ElevenLabs TTS provider against a mock transport.

No extra to skip on and no network: httpx is a core dependency, so the
whole provider (request shape, streaming, failures) runs here. What a
unit test cannot judge is how the real voice sounds and what the round
trip costs, which is the PR's real-API verification step.

What the type ACCEPTS is no longer asked here key by key. It is
`ElevenlabsOptions`, and its own suite is `test_provider_options.py`,
where the parity table holds it to what the reader before it took. What
stays here is the half that is this provider's rather than the model's:
the two things the builder computes from a validated instance (the rate
the format produces, the credential the options cannot hold), and every
refusal a build can still raise.
