"""Finding a past conversation and moving onto it, from inside a reply.

The three things this file is about are the three the flow can get
wrong. Which thread the session ends up on, which is state the runtime
owns and the store is only asked about. What the model is allowed to
pick, which is what this agent was offered and nothing else, an
utterance later included. And what a failure says, which is a fixed
sentence with nothing in it that a room or a driver wrote.

Everything is driven through the session drivers every other suite uses
and read where a suite can read it: the thread the next turn will be
recorded on, the turns the next round was handed, and the events the
session emitted. The store behind the seam is written down rather than
migrated, because none of what is under test here is SQL: the reads
themselves have their suite next door in `test_conversations_threads.py`,
and the sanitizing has its own case at the end of this one, against a
store that raises.
