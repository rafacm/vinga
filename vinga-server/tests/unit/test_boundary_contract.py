"""The boundary as a contract, exercised from both sides of the seam.

The point of #85 is that the device edge and a conversation runtime can
be reasoned about, and replaced, one at a time. Two suites prove it,
and they are deliberately small: what the pipeline decides is covered
by the pipeline's own tests, and re-testing it through the boundary
would be scope growth.

Downwards: a stub runtime, injected through the factory the composition
root normally fills, holds a whole turn over a real websocket. Nothing
of the pipeline is involved, so what the assertions see is the edge
alone, and the fact that the turn happens at all is the demonstration
that a second runtime can exist.

Upwards: a fake device, which is not a socket and knows no Opus, drives
the real bespoke runtime through a turn and an interruption. Nothing of
the wire is involved, so what the assertions see is the runtime alone.
