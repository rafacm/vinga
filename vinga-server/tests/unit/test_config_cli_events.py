"""`vinga events tail`: what it prints, when it stops, and what it must
never carry out of a stream.

The command is the one row of the grammar whose answer does not finish
arriving, and that is what every case here is about in the end. Three
things follow from it and none of them is shared with any other command.

**It stops on a contract rather than on an answer.** Without `--follow`
it waits for the first event the filters admit, prints it and exits 0.
With `--follow` it prints until something stops it, and there are
exactly two somethings: an interrupt, which is a reader who was told to
stop and exits 0, and the stream ending, which exits 1 and says so. A
tail that ended quietly would be a terminal that looks like a quiet
deployment, which is the failure this whole surface exists to prevent.

**One event is one physical line, by encoding.** An event's values are
identifiers, counts and reason tokens, and the identifier vocabulary
admits bytes a terminal reads as instructions. So the hostile values
below are not adversarial decoration: they are what the declared value
types permit, and the claim under test is that the line count does not
depend on them.

**The stream rides the request boundary, for its whole length.** A
stream can fail after the response has opened, which is the one place a
bare client would preserve nothing of `_sent`'s guarantees. The
planted-credential cases below therefore come in two: one that fails
before anything opens and one that fails with the stream already
running, and each hunts the credential on every surface a deployment
keeps.

The transport is a streaming one rather than the buffered test client,
through the seam `tests/support/config_cli.answering` adds: `TestClient`
reads a whole body before handing it back, and this body has no end, so
there is nothing for it to hand back at all.
