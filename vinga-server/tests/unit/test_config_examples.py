"""The committed example fragments, fed through the CLI they document.

A fragment nobody can install is worse than no fragment: it reads like
working documentation. So every file under `examples/` is run through
the command its own header names, in the creation order the reference
checks require, against a real sub-application over a scratch database.
The header comment is the input, which also pins that the command a
reader would copy is the command that works.

The deployment profile is checked the same way and for the same reason,
but it is a script that documents itself as running against a running
server, so it runs in the integration lane where there is one:
`tests/integration/test_config_examples.py`.

`config.example.yaml` is the other committed example, and the same
argument applies to it from the other side: a field it does not mention
is a field an operator never learns exists, since this file is where
the server half is documented for a reader rather than for a generator.
So the last test here walks `ServerConfig` and insists the example
mentions every field of it.
