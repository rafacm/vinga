"""What `events/assembly.py` builds, asked of its whole interface.

The module is what the reply path stopped knowing: a caller hands it
the thing that happened in plain values and is handed the variant that
describes it. So every claim here is made the way a caller makes it, by
calling an exported name, and every builder is checked against the
variant written out by hand, which is the comparison that would catch a
field landing in the wrong one.

The one structural claim is the entry quartet's, and it is made by two
tests that answer different halves of it. Since the collapse each of
the three events declares `provider`, `type`, `host` and `model` as
absent-able, so the variant itself would accept an entry name with no
type beside it; what refuses that is the frozen type inside this
module, whose `provider` and `type` are required, and the single
crossing from it to the fields.

That the crossing keeps its promise is what the builder test says: it
asks every builder that carries the quartet, over every shape an
identity has, and a crossing that answered a half quartet fails it.
That nothing ELSE can make the four is what the namespace test says: it
reads the module's public names rather than its `__all__`, since
`__all__` governs `import *` alone and a public helper added beside it
would pass a check on the list while being importable by anybody.
Together they are what makes "whole or not at all" a fact about the
module rather than a habit at its call sites. The emission-level half
of the same claim is in `test_event_surface_pins.py`, where a record
from a provider the registry never built is checked for the absence of
the key.

A declaration-time entanglement check, which would let the catalog say
this itself, is deliberately out of scope (#240); this file plus that
one is the pin standing in for it.
