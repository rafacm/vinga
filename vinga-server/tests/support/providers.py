"""The scripted far sides a session's pipeline runs against.

What belongs here is a stand-in for something the runtime talks to and
waits on: a model, an ear, a voice, an endpointer, the tool registry a
prompt is assembled from. Each one is scripted rather than clever, so a
test says in advance what the far side will do and then asserts on what
the session made of it.

Two rules keep these honest. A fake here implements only the calls the
runtime actually makes, so a stage growing a new method is a failure
rather than a silently unused stub; and a fake that fails does so in
the place a real one would, which is why the two broken voices below
are two classes rather than one with a flag.

Nothing here builds a session or touches a socket, so this module sits
directly on `vinga_server` and the standard library.
