"""Rendering a document in an interpreter that has imported nothing else.

The configuration package's rendering commands are usable on a machine
with no database, no encryption key and no configuration file, and that
claim is about an import graph rather than about intent: a module added
to the top of `docgen.py` next year would retract it silently. So it is
pinned by driving a child interpreter that starts empty, rendering the
document there, and reading back what got loaded.

Two suites make that claim now, about two documents rendered from the
same models, which is why the allow list and the runner are here rather
than in whichever of them was written first: a test module may not
import another test module (`test_support_boundaries.py`), and two
copies of a closed set are two sets that come to disagree.

`-B` for the reason `test_config_entities.py` gives: a child that writes
bytecode back hands the next command the stale cache `conftest.py` just
cleared.
