"""What every `vinga-server config` suite runs a command with.

The config command group's tests were one file until #139 split them
along the boundaries that issue produced, and five suites now drive the
same entry point: the acceptance spine, the transport client, the
runtime renderings, the secrets, and the grammar.
What they share is the scaffolding, and it lives here rather than in
whichever of them happened to be written first.

`runner` is the whole of it: one command run the way the entry point
runs it, against a server of the calling test's own. It is a factory
rather than a fixture because a fixture cannot be imported and used as a
fixture, and a `run` visible to the whole unit lane would be a name
nobody could place; each suite spends four lines wrapping it instead.

The sentinels are here for the same reason: a substring assertion about
a credential is worth nothing if the credential it looks for is not the
one the command was given, and six copies of a constant is six chances
for that.

# `show` row and the three words behind it went unread, though `show`
# takes no positional at all and the tree refuses that line. That is how
