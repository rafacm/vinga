"""The refusal body an API test expects, in one place.

Every route in the `/api` namespace refuses with the same body, so a
suite that spells that body out per assertion is holding one decision in
thirty places. This is the one place, and it offers two ways in.

`refused` is the ordinary one. It checks that a body is the shape every
refusal in this namespace answers with, and hands back the sentence
without comparing it: since #242 a suite asserts what a refusal IS (the
status, the standard reason phrase for it, the members and their types)
and the semantic tokens the sentence carries (a section, an entity, a
field path, a count), never the sentence itself. Wording is the
repository's to choose, and a suite that pinned it turned an edit to a
sentence into a red test with nothing wrong.

`problem` builds the whole body, sentence included, and is for the
assertions that are differential rather than golden: a body compared
against the exception the repository raised holds the two equal without
either of them being written down here. `PROBLEM_KEYS` is the key set,
for a test that is about the members alone.

The body is RFC 9457 problem details (#192): the status's reason phrase,
the status repeated, the repository's own sentence, and the fields the
refusal names, always present and empty where it names none.

Built literally rather than through the `Problem` model. An expectation
assembled from the code it checks agrees with it by construction, which
is not an assertion about anything. The one thing read from the
application is the title, because a table of reason phrases restated
here would be a second copy of a closed set; what the phrases are is
pinned where the table is.

    `errors` carrying a string path and a string message. What the
    sentence says is returned rather than compared, so the caller can
    assert the tokens that carry meaning and leave the wording alone.

    `reason` is the exception rather than a sixth member: a handful of
    refusals carry the state they are in as a closed token, and every
    other refusal carries exactly the four members it always has. So a
    caller that expects a token names it and gets the member set
    checked with it, and a caller that names none gets the strict four,
