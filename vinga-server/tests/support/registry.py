"""The two registers a running server keeps about devices.

One is in memory: which sessions are open, which is what a drain walks
on the way out. The other is on disk: which board is bound to which
agent, which is what an operator writes while the server runs. What
belongs here is the scaffolding for both, since a test about either is a
test about a server that is already up.

The scripted session answers the way a real one does about the only
thing a drain asks it (did your reply finish inside the grace) and
records how it was asked, so a drain test reads the record rather than
the clock. The binding half writes through the repository the CLI and
the API write through, deliberately on a different connection from the
one the running app reads.

`BINDINGS_DEVICE_MAC` is the normalized form the bindings table stores,
which is not the form `configs.DEVICE_MAC` presents at a handshake, so
it is a definition of its own rather than a second spelling of that one.
