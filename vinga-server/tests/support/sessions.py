"""Building a `DeviceSession` in process, and driving a reply through it.

The other way to drive a session is over the wire (`wire.py`); this is
the way a test takes when it is about what the reply decides rather
than what the device hears. Everything here builds a real session with
a real runtime behind it, assembled the way `run` assembles one, so the
composition root has one shape in the tests as well as in the server.
That is the rule for this module: a builder here calls the same factory
the server calls, and substitutes collaborators through the arguments
that factory already takes, rather than reaching past it.

The reading is the second part. What a session did is asked of the
things that received it: the agent talking is read off the events
object, where both sides of the boundary read it, and the conversation
it kept is read from the round after, because the history exists so
that the next round is written against what was said.

Who holds the floor is the third, and the only part of this module that
is white-box throughout. Its note says why once, for all four of its
names.

The drivers are the fourth. A reply has three useful shapes to a test:
run it for a sentence the test names and answer what was spoken, run it
whole with the audio, or start it and leave it in flight the way an
utterance leaves one, so that everything asking whether this session is
replying sees it. Their note says which of the three is public.

The last section is the waiting a conversation suite does on the writer
running behind the session. Its bound is `WRITER_TIMEOUT_S` rather than
`TIMEOUT_S`, which `configs.py` already uses for a test-scale watchdog
of 50 ms: the two mean opposite things, so they do not share a name.

    in the tests as well as in the server.

    `mcp_servers` is the running registry, which a test that is about
    tools supplies; an empty one is what every other test here needs,
    and is what a deployment with no MCP entries has. `conversations` is
    the store a turn's record is handed to, None everywhere but in the
    suite that is about the record, which is what a deployment that has
    not asked for one has. `threads` is the other direction through the
    same store, the read a resume goes through, and None is the same
    kind of absence; a session resumes nothing unless it is handed one
    AND its configuration switched resumption on, which is the runtime's
    own read of the section rather than this argument.

    `generations` is the holder the server would hand the factory, and
    it is a parameter for the one kind of test that needs it: a reload
    replaces what the holder answers, so a suite about what a session
    reads across an apply has to build its session against the holder
    the apply installs into. Everything else gets a holder over the

    `fillers` are the clips that world holds, since a session binds them
    off its generation rather than being handed them: a suite that wants
    a masked session says which clips the world has, and a suite that
    hands its own holder in has already said. `fallbacks` is the other
    cache on the same generation and is passed the same way; absent is a
    world nothing was synthesized for, where a failed reply is the
    silence it was before the phrase existed.

    `memory` is the one collaborator with a default rather than an
    absence, because there is no deployment without a memory store
    (#314). None means the lane's own, which is empty unless the test
    put something in it; a suite that wants a store which cannot reach
    its database hands one in.

    `devices` is the view a reply asks what device it is speaking
    through, and it defaults the way a server with no database composes
    one: over the world being served, which answers from the device
    records that world holds. A suite about a record changing under a

# Four reaches, one reason, stated once. The turn-taking side is reached
# through `SessionInput` in production: the edge feeds it audio and tells
# it a `listen start` or a `listen stop` arrived, and everything else it
# does it decides for itself off the endpointer. That is the whole
# public surface, and it is not enough for a suite about the deciding.
#
# An endpointer-driven end of utterance is a decision the endpointer
# makes while audio is being fed, and the device has no message for it;
# `listen stop` is the manual end, which is a different gate with a
# different rule and the one thing these tests must not use. What the
# buffer holds at that instant is what the gates measure, and putting
# real speech there means a real VAD classifying synthetic tones and
# ending the utterance at a moment nothing chose. And the reply task is
# what `replying()` and `drain()` answer about without handing over, so
# a caller that has to await this one exactly, cancellation included,
# holds it.
