"""Fakes shaped like the SDKs the two LLM dialects stream through.

What belongs here is a double for an object the vendor SDK hands the
provider, not a double for anything vinga owns: a stream, a chunk, a
delta, the completions endpoint the provider calls. The providers take
their client by injection, so a test can drive a whole stream without a
network, a key, or a mock library, and these classes are the shapes
that client returns.

They live in support rather than in one provider's test module because
they describe the vendor dialects, not one suite's cases: the anthropic
messages-stream family and the openai chat-completions family are what
any future test of either dialect needs, and copying them into a second
module is how two descriptions of one wire protocol start to drift.

Each class carries only the attributes the provider under test reads,
so a shape that grows a field the provider ignores does not grow here.
