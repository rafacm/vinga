"""Which boundary a write's acknowledgement announces.

Every write to the configuration API and every local write through the
CLI answers with a `notice`, and what it is for is one question: when
does what I just wrote reach a running server. There are four answers,
and which one an act carries is behavior a suite has to hold. The
sentence that carries it is not: prose gets edited, and a suite that
compared the whole string turned an edit that changed no boundary into
a wall of red.

So this is the one place that reads a notice, and it answers in the
tokens the API publishes, which every suite downstream asserts. An edit
to a notice that keeps its boundary keeps every one of them green.

What it no longer does is guess. A body carries `applies` beside the
sentence, so the boundary is read off the field where there is a body;
what a command printed is matched against the lines either side
composes, each of which carries its own boundaries (`entities.Notice`
for the server's, `output.SPOKEN` for the ones the client says instead of
one). Neither is a table of phrases kept by hand beside the real one,
which is what this module used to be and what a prose edit could
silently move.

The four, and why they are four rather than two:

- `CHECK_IN`, the device asking. Device bindings and the default agent
  are read as a device asks for them, so nothing is asked of the server.
- `RELOAD`, an operator asking. The whole rest of the domain half is
  applied by `POST /runtime/config/reload`.
- `RESTART`, this process starting again. The file half only, which this
  API does not write; it is declared and stays reachable.
- `STORE_BOOT`, some server starting from this store. What a write is
  told when the server answering it serves a configuration it was handed
  rather than one it read, so nothing it is running reads what was
  written.

A binding to an agent this server is not serving names two of them at
once, which is why the answer is a set rather than a token.
