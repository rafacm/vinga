"""Building MCP entries, and standing a real server up behind them.

The MCP suites never fake the protocol: the stdio ones spawn
`mcp_stdio_server.py` as a subprocess and the HTTP one hosts a `FastMCP`
app on a port the OS picks, so what is under test is the transport that
ships. What belongs here is everything around that: the entry a
configuration names a server with, the configurations whose agents are
granted it, the manager and registry builders that start one, the
re-read a reload is handed, and the context manager that serves an app
for the length of a block.

Nothing here asserts. A helper here hands back a started thing or a
`Config`, and the suite says what it expects of it.

`config_granting` and `reload_config` are both "a configuration whose
agents reach these entries", and they are kept apart because they are
not the same configuration: the second also carries a declared data
boundary, which
is the switch its own suite is about.

The file is called `tools_mcp.py` rather than `mcp.py` after the
production module it serves, because `mcp_stdio_server.py` beside it is
run as a script: that puts this directory first on the subprocess's
path, and a module named `mcp.py` here would be what its
`from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP` finds.
