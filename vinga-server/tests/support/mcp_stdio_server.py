"""A real MCP server for the tests, spoken to over stdio.

Small on purpose, and real on purpose: the tests spawn this as a
subprocess so the client transport under test is the one that ships,
without a network, a key, or anything to mock. Launched with
`sys.executable` so CI needs nothing installed beyond the project's own
dependencies.

Run it by path: `python tests/support/mcp_stdio_server.py`.
