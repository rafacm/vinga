"""What each dependency tier is declared to be, and what each extra's
distributions import as.

Two lanes ask. The tier closure lane proves what the DECLARATION
resolves to, by syncing an environment against the lock and comparing it
exactly. The wheel lane proves what the ARTIFACT carries, by reading the
built wheel's own `Requires-Dist` and by asserting the serve half is
absent from the environment that wheel was installed into. Both need the
same two facts, and two copies of a tier list is the pending bug the
design guide names: the copies drift, and the lane holding the older one
reports a tier that has not existed for a while.

The import-name map is written out rather than derived. A
distribution's import name is not in its requirement string, and
guessing it by replacing hyphens is how a typo becomes a check that
always passes; each lane holds the map to covering the declared tier
exactly, so a dependency added to `serve` or to `sim` without a name here
fails.

This module is the one home both lanes read a tier from, which is why
`sim` had to arrive HERE and not only as a third fixture. `declared()`
returning two sets while `pyproject.toml` declared three would have let
an extra missing from the wheel's own metadata pass every lane, which is
exactly the gap the wheel's metadata check was added to close for
`serve`.

`otel` is the fourth (#66), and it arrived the way `sim` did: a row
here, an import map, an isolated environment in the closure lane, and
the wheel's own metadata held to the declaration. What it answers is
`declared().otel`, because the three tiers used to be a positional
triple that every consumer unpacked with two underscores in it, and a
fourth would have renumbered every one of those reads while the
compiler said nothing. A named field cannot be read as the wrong tier.
