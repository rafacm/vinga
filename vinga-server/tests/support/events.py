"""Reading the structured log a suite has just provoked.

A conversation says what it did through `extra=` fields on log records,
never in the message text, so a test that is about an event reads
`caplog.records` and looks for the `event` field. What belongs here is
that reading: selecting the records of one event, insisting a run
produced exactly one of them, separating a record's structured half
from the attributes every record carries, and rendering a run every way
a deployment would keep it, which is what a no-leak test hunts in.
Nothing here provokes an event, so this module knows nothing of
sessions, sockets or providers, and imports only pytest and `logs.py`'s
own formatters and attribute set.

The MCP suites called the first two `emitted` and `one_event` and the
session suites called them `events` and `only`. They were the same two
functions, so one pair lives here and the modules that spelled them the
other way keep their spelling through an import alias.
