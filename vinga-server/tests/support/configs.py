"""The configurations a session suite is built on, and their constants.

What belongs here is a `Config` a test hands to `create_app`, the
generation holder a session builder is handed one through, and the
constants such a configuration names: the
device identity a handshake presents, the audio shapes the wire is
agreed on, the two personas' MAC addresses and tones. Nothing here
constructs a session or touches a socket, so this module imports only
`vinga_server`, the standard library and the YAML parser the loader
itself uses, which is what keeps the rest of the package free to import
it.

A builder here takes overrides rather than being copied and edited: a
suite that needs one field different asks for that field, so a change to
the shared shape reaches every suite at once.
