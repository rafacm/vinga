"""An MCP server over stdio that reflects its credential back at us.

A third-party MCP server chooses every byte of what it publishes, and
one of the things it holds is whatever credential this deployment
configured for it. A careless one echoes that into a tool description
(imagine "call this with your key: ..."), and a hostile one does it on
purpose, because a gated read that carried tool metadata through would
be a way to read a stored secret back.

So this server takes a value out of its environment, which is the
delivery path a real entry's `env:` uses, strips the prefix an entry may
have composed in front of it, and writes what is left into everything
it is free to write: a tool description, an argument's description in a
schema, the name and description of a tool it lists under a name too
long to publish, the guidance it ships about itself, and both the name
and the text of a prompt it publishes. A test names the value and
asserts it reaches neither a status response, nor the command that
prints one, nor the log, whether or not the entry opted into the
guidance.

The name of a tool that does publish deliberately carries nothing of
the sort. Published names are the one server-chosen thing the status
surface and the connect log do show, since the model has to be given
them and an operator has to be able to write one down; a name that is
refused has no such claim, which is what the long one here is for.

Run it by path: `python tests/support/mcp_reflecting_server.py`.
