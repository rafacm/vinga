"""The seam-testing template: drive one side from a scripted far side.

The device edge and a conversation runtime meet at one boundary, and
the point of that boundary (#85) is that either side can be reasoned
about, and replaced, without the other. A test proves that by supplying
the far side itself, so what its assertions see is one side alone.

There are two directions, and this module holds one stand-in for each.
`StubRuntime` is a conversation runtime that is not a pipeline: no VAD,
no ASR, no model and no voice, answering whatever it is handed through
`DeviceOutput` alone, so a suite driving it over a real websocket is
watching the edge and nothing else. `FakeDevice` is a device that is
not a socket: no protocol, no codec, no clock, so a suite driving the
real runtime against it is watching the runtime and nothing else.

This is the pattern to copy when a new seam wants covering: name the
far side after the side it replaces, give it only the calls the near
side makes, and keep the one fact the seam turns on (here, that the
device's encoder emits nothing until a whole frame is there).

The frame size here is the output rate's, which is not the wire's:
`tests.support.configs.FRAME_BYTES` is a frame of 16 kHz microphone
audio, and `OUTPUT_FRAME_BYTES` below is a frame of 24 kHz reply audio.
