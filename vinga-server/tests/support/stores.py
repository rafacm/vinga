"""What a suite writes into a store, and how it reads one back.

Two places keep what a conversation produced: the capture directory and
the conversation record's schema, with the memory schema beside them.
What belongs here is the scaffolding around all three: the
manifest each kind of session is opened with, a store built where a
test can reach it, the audio a channel is filled with, a read through a
second engine, the second writer four suites need in order to prove the
retryable refusal, the thread store a session resumes through written
down as two dictionaries, and the memory stores whose two engines are
pointed at a database that is not there on purpose.

Nothing here asserts and nothing here drives a session. A helper returns
a store, a payload or a list of rows, and the suite says what it expects.

The two manifests are called `CAPTURE_MANIFEST` and
`CONVERSATIONS_MANIFEST` because they were both called `MANIFEST` where
they came from and they are not the same shape: one is what a capture
writes beside its WAVs, the other is the session row a conversation
opens with. Both importing suites keep their own spelling by alias.
