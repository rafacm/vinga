"""Where the tests reach past an interface, counted rather than remembered.

The design guide's rule is that a test reaches the names a caller
reaches, so an underscore reach-in is a review flag: either the module
is missing an interface callers need, or the test pins a detail that is
free to change. #210's M6 acts on that rule across the whole suite, and
acting on it needs a census rather than an impression.

What counts as a site: a NAME token spelled `_x` (one leading
underscore, then a letter) immediately after an `OP` `.`, anywhere under
`tests/`. A tokenizer rather than an AST walk because the question is
lexical: `session._opened_at` is a reach-in whatever the expression in
front of the dot evaluates to, and a walk that resolved receivers would
have to know what every fixture returns.

What does not count: `self._x` and `cls._x`. A test file's own fakes and
its own test classes keep private state of their own, and that state is
theirs; reaching for it crosses no interface. Those are counted
separately and reported, so the exclusion is visible rather than
silent.

    uv run python -m tests.tools.reach_ins            # summary
    uv run python -m tests.tools.reach_ins --by-site  # file:line per site
    uv run python -m tests.tools.reach_ins --json     # the whole census

The before-and-after numbers this produces are recorded in the
implementation doc of
`docs/plans/2026-08-19-governance-simplification.md`.

    manifest is diffed against this walk, because a stray

    `git -C <root> ls-files -z -- .` lists tracked paths relative to

    is the part an ambient `git ls-files` gets wrong: the same tool run

    render different paths. The `*.py` filter is applied afterwards,
    since `ls-files` lists everything and this census is a Python
    tokenizer.

    A root git cannot list is refused by name rather than falling back
    to a filesystem walk. Two enumerations would be two structures that
