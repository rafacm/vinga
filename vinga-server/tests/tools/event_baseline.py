"""Every emit path, and what makes it fire.

A driver inventory, and nothing more than that. "Baseline" was once a
committed capture of what these paths produced, kept so a conversion
could show the file did not move; that file is gone (#241), and with it
the regeneration command and the byte comparison it fed. What is left is
the machinery: eighty-four drivers, one per emit path, and the two
functions that run them and reduce what they produced to the dimensions
a consumer sees (`driven()` and `captured()`). Nothing here is written
to disk, and there is nothing to regenerate.

What the drivers are held to is `tests/unit/test_event_baseline.py`,
live and against the declarations rather than against a file: every
produced record conforms to the variant its event declares, every driver
carries the fields its path is supposed to carry, and the payload values
are builtins. `docs/reference/events.md` is the committed artifact where
a catalog change is a reviewed diff.

**The completeness claim comes from the catalog, not from this file.** A
runtime harness proves only what it executes, so on its own a set of
drivers proves whatever it happens to run. Every variant the catalog
declares is constructible, and therefore directly drivable, so the suite
holds every one of them to being produced by some driver's run, and a
declaration nothing can produce fails the lane. Beside it, the smaller
claim these drivers can give themselves: one driver per identity,
eighty-four of them, and every record a driver keeps is the event that
driver names.

There used to be a static walk here instead, reading the scoped modules
for emit sites and holding the drivers equal to what it found. It
existed because an untyped emit site was invisible to anything but a
reading of the source: the only way to know a path had no driver was to
find the path in the code. It retired with the last conversion (#210),
along with its chooser-reading, its emitter-binding reading and the
planted sources it was proved on.

`identity` is where a path is, and `event` is what it emits, which is
what its capture is filtered to: a session driver reaches its decision
by holding a whole conversation, so its run emits every neighbouring
path's records too.

The drivers reach into the store and the capture the way the pin suites
they came from do: a writer parked on its gate, an engine that raises, a
free-space reading that refuses, a clock the harness chose. Those
reach-ins are the price of driving a failure path deterministically, and
they are the same ones `test_conversations_store.py` pays.
