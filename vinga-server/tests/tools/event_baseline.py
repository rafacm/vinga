"""What every emit path produces, recorded so a change to it is loud.

The #143 wire baseline, applied to log records. A conversion milestone's
whole claim is that the surface did not move, and the honest way to make
that claim is to record what every path produces, convert, record again,
and show the two are the same file. So this drives each of the
eighty-one paths and captures the five dimensions a consumer sees: the
channel, the numeric level, the unrendered template, the TYPES of the
arguments behind it, and the payload's keys.

Types rather than values for the arguments, and keys rather than values
for the payload, because a baseline is about shape: a temporary
directory and a class name move between runs, and a file that changed
every run would be a file nobody reads. What the values are is the
golden inventory's question and the behavioral suites'.

**The completeness claim comes from the catalog, not from this file.** A
runtime harness proves only what it executes, so on its own a set of
drivers proves whatever it happens to run. Every variant the catalog
declares is constructible, and therefore directly drivable, so
`tests/unit/test_event_baseline.py` holds all eighty-five of them to
being produced by some driver's run, and a declaration nothing can
produce fails the lane. Beside it, the smaller claim these drivers can
give themselves: one driver per identity, eighty-one of them, and every
record a driver keeps is the event that driver names.

There used to be a static walk here instead, reading the scoped modules
for emit sites and holding the drivers equal to what it found. It
existed because an untyped emit site was invisible to anything but a
reading of the source: the only way to know a path had no driver was to
find the path in the code. It retired with the last conversion (#210),
along with its chooser-reading, its emitter-binding reading and the
planted sources it was proved on.

`identity` is where a path is, and `event` is what it emits, which is
what its capture is filtered to: a session driver reaches its decision
by holding a whole conversation, so its run emits every neighbouring
path's records too. Regenerate the committed file deliberately:

    uv run python -m tests.tools.event_baseline

The drivers reach into the store and the capture the way the pin suites
they came from do: a writer parked on its gate, an engine that raises, a
free-space reading that refuses, a clock the harness chose. Those
reach-ins are the price of driving a failure path deterministically, and
they are the same ones `test_conversations_store.py` pays.

# runtime/filler_runner.py
#
# A stall of this milliseconds' own scale, the way
# `tests/unit/test_session_filler.py` keeps a local one: the shared
# `STALL_S` is 30 s, which the watchdog suites never wait out because
# the watchdog cancels the sleep, but no filler driver shrinks the
# watchdog's bound, so here the 10 s bound was waited out in full, twice
# per driver (a 10 s production-default window, one retry, a second
# window, and the round given up).
#
# What each of the three drivers below needs is only that the filler's
# timer expires while the reply is still silent, which is a race between
# the 60 ms `DELAY_MS` and this: 0.5 s is over eight times it, and the
# reply now simply succeeds at 0.5 s instead of being given up at 20 s.
# The three `filler_*` records the drivers keep are emitted before
# `FillerRunner._fire` touches the reply at all: the two skips emit and
# return, and `filler_played` is emitted before `begin_speaking()` is
# awaited. So what the stalled round eventually does reaches none of
# them.
