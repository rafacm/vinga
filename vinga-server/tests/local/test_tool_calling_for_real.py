"""A real local model deciding to call a tool, on the desk, not in CI.

The scripted mock in the integration lane proves the plumbing: the
server routes a call, the tool answers, the answer reaches the reply.
What it cannot prove is that a real model, given these tool
definitions, works out that it should call one. That is what this does,
against the same stdio MCP server the integration lane spawns, through
Ollama. Run it with:

    VINGA_LOCAL_LANE=1 uv run pytest tests/local -q

Not every Ollama model supports tool calling, so the pre-flight below
insists on one that does and says how to name another.
