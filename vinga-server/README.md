# vinga-server

The Vinga conversation server (Python): a wire-compatible backend for
[78/xiaozhi-esp32](https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32) devices, written
against the firmware's
[protocol docs](https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32/blob/main/docs/websocket.md);
the device-token scheme follows
[xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-esp32-server](https://github.com/xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-esp32-server).

It implements the two endpoints a device needs:

- **HTTP OTA/config endpoint** (`/xiaozhi/ota/`): the device POSTs its
  identity and receives the WebSocket URL (and optionally firmware updates).
- **WebSocket endpoint** (`/xiaozhi/v1/`): the conversation channel,
  carrying Opus audio frames up, JSON control messages both ways, and Opus
  audio back.

Behind the WebSocket sits the conversation pipeline: VAD segments speech,
ASR transcribes it, the LLM streams a reply, and TTS speaks it back
sentence by sentence, every stage a pluggable provider chosen per agent.
Agents reach tools over MCP, both their own servers and the device's own
controls.

Those four acronyms are the vocabulary of the whole configuration, so in
full:

| Stage | | What it does |
| ----- | - | ------------ |
| `vad` | voice activity detection | Decides where speech starts and when the user has stopped, so the rest of the pipeline runs on an utterance rather than on a stream |
| `asr` | automatic speech recognition | Turns that utterance into text. Also called speech to text |
| `llm` | large language model | Writes the reply, and asks for tools |
| `tts` | text to speech | Turns each sentence of the reply back into audio |

They run strictly in that order, each waiting on the one before it, which
is why the latency of any one of them is latency the user hears.

Those two paths, the two probes `/healthz` and `/readyz`, and the
configuration API under `/api` are
everything the server exposes: the interactive API docs are turned off,
the WebSocket requires a device token the OTA endpoint issued, and every
request to `/api` carries a bearer token.

## Goals

- Python, and one Postgres database holding everything this server
  stores: the domain half of the configuration in a `domain` schema,
  and the conversation record, when it is turned on, in a
  `record` schema beside it. Both are migrated at every boot,
  so a blank database is a valid state to start on and there is no
  init command to forget
- Configurable providers:
  - **LLM**: Anthropic, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, LM Studio,
    gateways)
  - **ASR**: local (faster-whisper) or cloud (OpenAI, and anything
    speaking the same dialect)
  - **TTS**: pluggable engines as optional extras (Piper)
  - **MCP**: attach any MCP servers as tools for the assistant, alongside
    the device's own
- Distributed as a multi-arch container image, deployable on your own
  infrastructure

## Providers

Each pipeline stage is a named provider entry in the configuration, and
each agent picks one provider per stage. The v1 set:

| Stage | Type                | Runs               | Install                          |
| ----- | ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| vad   | `silero`            | locally            | core (pysilero-vad)              |
| asr   | `faster_whisper`    | locally            | `uv sync --extra faster-whisper` |
| asr   | `openai`            | OpenAI or anywhere | core                             |
| llm   | `anthropic`         | Anthropic          | core                             |
| llm   | `openai_compatible` | anywhere           | core                             |
| tts   | `piper`             | locally            | `uv sync --extra piper`          |
| tts   | `elevenlabs`        | ElevenLabs         | core                             |
| tts   | `openai`            | OpenAI or anywhere | core                             |
| any   | `mock`              | in tests           | core (deterministic, keyless)    |

"Anywhere" is a `base_url`: those three types speak a dialect rather
than name a vendor, so each reaches a self-hosted server implementing
the same endpoint. That is what keeps a fully local pipeline available
through them, and it is why they cannot declare their own egress.

Model weights are never shipped: faster-whisper models and Piper voices
download at server startup into a local cache (`download_dir` on the
provider entry). A fully local, keyless pipeline is Silero +
faster-whisper + Ollama (through `openai_compatible`) + Piper, and
`server.local_only: true` makes the server refuse to boot anything
else (see Security below).

The Install column is a checkout's, since a deployment installs nothing:
both image variants carry `core`, and the default variant carries the
two extras as well. "Core" here means the server half, which a checkout
gets from a plain `uv sync` and the image build gets from the `serve`
extra it names in its Dockerfile. The configuration CLI is the other
half and carries none of this.

Cloud providers need no extra. They speak their APIs over HTTP, or
through an SDK the server install already carries for another stage, so
they are in every server and cost nothing to carry; what makes a
provider optional is weight or licensing, and a network client has
neither.

Licensing note: `piper-tts` (piper1-gpl) is GPL-3.0, which is why it is an
optional extra and never a core dependency of the MIT server. The same
applies to any future `edge-tts` provider.

### Choosing how it hears

The ASR stage has two types, and the trade between them is not the one
the voices have. Going to the cloud for a voice costs latency; going
to the cloud to listen mostly saves it, because a transcription is one
round trip against someone else's accelerator instead of a CPU decode
on yours. Median of five per utterance, one machine and one network,
so the columns are comparable:

| Utterance | `faster_whisper` small | `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` | `gpt-4o-transcribe` | `whisper-1` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "The kitchen light is now off." (1.8 s) | 1688 ms | 536 ms | 627 ms | 1076 ms |
| "Hello, I am your vinga assistant..." (3.6 s) | 1781 ms | 658 ms | 887 ms | 1177 ms |
| "Hej, jag är din vingasassistent." (2.1 s) | 1743 ms | 545 ms | 607 ms | 1101 ms |

Read that against your own hardware before believing it: the local
column is an int8 CPU decode on a laptop, and a machine with a GPU
would change the answer. The cloud column would not move much, since
almost all of it is the round trip.

**The same measurement on a real device narrows the gap a long way.**
Taken from the server's own log on a Waveshare ESP32-S3, `heard` minus
the end of the utterance, so it is the whole stage and not just the
call:

| | on the board | on the desk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` | 642, 647, 825 ms | 536 to 658 ms |
| `faster_whisper` small | 964 ms (one sample) | 1688 to 1781 ms |

The cloud figures held; the local one did not, which says the desk
number for `faster_whisper` was measured under contention and flatters
the cloud. Treat the first table's local column as a worst case and
this one as the honest comparison, and measure your own either way.

Accuracy is the other half, and it separates them further, *provided
the language is pinned*. The caveat is not a footnote: see "Set
`language`" below, because unpinned on a real device the cloud engine
was the worse of the two. Synthesized speech under white noise,
standing in for a far-field microphone:

| Signal to noise | `faster_whisper` small | `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` | `gpt-4o-transcribe` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| clean | exact | exact | exact |
| 10 dB | Swedish already wrong | exact | exact |
| 5 dB | Swedish wrong | exact | exact |
| 0 dB | Swedish is a different sentence | exact | exact |

English survived everywhere; Swedish is where the local `small` model
gives up, turning "vingasassistent" into "samhållssystem" at 10 dB
and the whole sentence into unrelated English at 0 dB. A larger local
model closes some of that, at a latency cost the table above already
shows there is no room for.

That table is synthesized speech, which is cleaner than a room. On the
device, with both engines pinned to Swedish, the cloud engine was still
the better of the two but neither was perfect:

| Said to the board | `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` | `faster_whisper` small |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Vad heter Sveriges huvudstad?" | exact | "Vad heter Sveriges Hubbetsstad?" |
| "Vad heter din vingasassistent?" | "Vad hette ditt vingasassistent?" | "Men hejter den vingaassistenten." |

What the local engine still wins: it is the only one that keeps the
audio on your host, and it is the only one that reports which language
it heard. It is also free per utterance, which a busy household
notices.

### OpenAI transcription

```bash
vinga-server config provider set asr ears -f - <<'YAML'
type: openai
api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY
prompt: vinga
YAML
```

Keys are named, never written, exactly as for the TTS types above.

| Option | Default | What it does |
| ------ | ------- | ------------ |
| `api_key_env` | required for OpenAI itself | Name of the variable holding the key |
| `model` | `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` | `gpt-4o-transcribe` is the larger sibling; `whisper-1` is the same Whisper V2 you could run locally |
| `base_url` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | Point it at any server implementing `/v1/audio/transcriptions` |
| `prompt` | unset | Vocabulary the engine would not otherwise guess: names, places, the assistant's own. Never agent names or anything imperative: see below |
| `language` | unset | Spoken language (ISO 639-1). Set it for any non-English deployment: see below |
| `temperature` | unset | 0.0 to 1.0, the API's own default when unset |
| `timeout_s` | `30` | Seconds before a transcription is abandoned, and a real bound: retries are off |

**This `prompt` is not the agent's prompt.** Two unrelated options share
the name: the one here is a list of words the transcriber should expect,
and the one under `agents:` is the agent's instruction sent to the LLM.
This one is a hint about vocabulary, not a request for behaviour, which
is exactly what makes the failure below surprising.

**Set `prompt`, and keep it to vocabulary.** An unfamiliar proper noun
is the one thing this type reliably gets wrong, and the prompt is what
fixes it: under noise, "vinga" came back as "sample" without it and as
"Vinga" with it. It fixes vocabulary, not language, so it cannot
compensate for the setting below: on the board, `prompt: vinga` still
produced "samstal" until `language` was pinned, and produced
"vingasassistent" exactly once it was.

**Never put anything the assistant could act on in it.** On short or
low-content audio the model hands the prompt back as the transcript
instead of hearing anything, reliably: 45 out of 45 clips of room tone
under a second came back as the prompt word for word. A prompt of plain
vocabulary makes that harmless noise. A prompt naming your agents makes
it an instruction, and in a field session it was one: a 0.9 s utterance
transcribed as `vinga, Oliver, Greta, Mateo`, and the model read the
agent names as a request and handed over to an agent nobody had
asked for. The server never hands a transcript that is the prompt and
nothing else (trimmed, case-insensitive, and ignoring a full stop the
model added) to the LLM as if spoken. Nor does it treat the echo as
proof of silence, because a field test caught that reading swallowing
real speech: nine echoes in two days of testing, every one on a clip
under two seconds, two of them a user saying "yes, please" and being
ignored.
An echoed clip is transcribed once more with the prompt withheld; a
real short answer survives that retry and is heard normally, genuine
silence comes back empty and is discarded, and each trip logs one
`asr_prompt_echo` event saying which it was. The rule stands anyway:
wake words, agent names and anything imperative do not belong here.
Recognising an agent's name when it is genuinely spoken is worth less
than never acting on one that was not.

**Set `language` unless the household speaks English.** This is the
one setting a device checkpoint changed our mind about. On clean audio,
leaving it unset costs nothing: recognition is multilingual either way,
and detection happens inside the model rather than as a separate pass
you pay for. On a real board in a real room it is a different story.
Unpinned, Swedish came back as English-shaped nonsense:

| Said to the board | Unpinned | `language: sv` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Vad heter Sveriges huvudstad?" | "Hat hetas verigezogistad." | exact |
| "Vad heter din vingasassistent?" | "Wat hat er dien samstal asynstind?" | "Vad hette ditt vingasassistent?" |

The audio was not the problem; the language choice was. Far-field mic
audio through Opus gives detection much less to go on than a clean
file, and the model appears to fall back on English phonetics. Pinning
fixed it outright, and no `prompt` rescued it while unpinned.

Setting it is still a hint rather than a hard pin: a `gpt-4o` model
given Swedish audio and `language: en` answers in Swedish anyway, where
the local engine would have forced the wrong language and produced
nonsense. So a wrong value is fairly harmless, and it is leaving it
*empty* that costs you.

**No language is reported back.** `AsrResult`'s language fields stay
empty, so the `heard` log line carries no `language`, and there is no
`language_detect` option. The API returns a language only for
`whisper-1` asked for a format the other models do not support, as an
English name rather than an ISO code, and never a confidence. An empty
field beats a guess, and nothing is lost: the local engine's
`language_detect: once` exists to skip a detection pass that costs
seconds of CPU, and here detection is free.

**It does not stream, deliberately.** The stage hands over one whole
utterance and the LLM cannot start on half a sentence, so response
deltas would arrive before anything could use them. The TTS stage is
the opposite case and does stream.

**Very short audio is answered empty without a request.** OpenAI
refuses anything under 0.1 s, and the barge-in path is what would send
it: a snippet classified as speech mid-reply gets transcribed to
decide whether the interruption was real. That refusal would be logged
as a failure rather than the non-answer it is. The floor was measured
against OpenAI and applies only there. A compatible endpoint that
accepts shorter clips receives them, because suppressing one it would
have answered would drop a barge-in it could have confirmed.

`base_url` is the same door the `openai_compatible` LLM type and the
`openai` TTS type open, with the same consequences: the host rather
than the spelling decides whether an entry counts as OpenAI, a
`base_url` that is not a URL fails the boot, and the endpoint rather
than the type decides egress, so an entry under `server.local_only`
carries its own `egress: false`.

Only OpenAI's own host *requires* a key. A keyless self-hosted server
can leave `api_key_env` out, but a gateway or hosted endpoint that
authenticates still names its variable there and the key is sent, so
"compatible" does not mean "keyless".

**It sends the microphone audio wherever `base_url` points**, which by
default is OpenAI, and that is a stronger claim than the TTS types
make: what leaves is what was said in the room, not what the assistant
answered. See Security below for how `server.local_only` treats it.

### Choosing a voice

The three TTS types differ in the one thing a conversation actually
feels: how long the device stays silent before it starts speaking.
Measured on one machine in a single run, median of five rounds per
sentence, so the columns are comparable with each other:

| | Piper | ElevenLabs | OpenAI |
| --- | ----- | ---------- | ------ |
| "The kitchen light is now off." | 40 ms | 194 ms | 888 ms |
| "Hello, I am your vinga assistant..." | 79 ms | 188 ms | 764 ms |
| "Hej, jag är din vingasassistent." | 54 ms | 194 ms | 818 ms |
| Runs | on your host | ElevenLabs | OpenAI |
| Needs | `--extra piper` | a key | a key |

Read down the columns, not across the rows. Piper is the only one
whose figure grows with sentence length, because it synthesizes a
whole sentence before yielding anything; both cloud types stream, so
their figure is flat and a longer sentence starts no later than a
short one. Past a long enough sentence Piper is the slower of the two
to start speaking, even though it is local.

**The number above is only the start of the reply, and it used to not
be the whole cost.** A reply is spoken sentence by sentence, and each
sentence used to be synthesized only once the previous one had
finished playing, so the same wait fell at every sentence boundary
too. On a three-sentence reply:

| | Gap at each sentence boundary | Total dead air mid-reply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Piper | 40 to 80 ms | negligible |
| ElevenLabs | 129 to 139 ms | 268 ms |
| OpenAI | 478 to 884 ms | 1362 ms |

Around 130 ms passed unnoticed. Around 600 ms did not: it was audible
as the voice stuttering every few seconds through a long reply, and
worse than a plain pause, because the frame pacer's schedule is
absolute from the reply's first frame, so the frames after a stall
burst out to catch up. The device got a dropout followed by a flood.

The server now synthesizes the next sentence while the current one is
still playing, so that latency is spent against playback that is
already happening. The same replies, measured again: every
boundary is one frame, 60 ms, which is the cadence rather than a gap.
The table above is what it cost before, kept because it is what the
start-of-reply figure has to be weighed against if a provider ever
becomes slower than a sentence is long.

This leaves the start of the reply as the only latency a listener
meets, which is a one-time delay a person tolerates rather than a
defect they notice every few seconds. It is why the recommendation
below no longer bounds a cloud provider on latency alone.

So: **Piper** if it must stay on your host or cost nothing per
character, **ElevenLabs** for the best voice per millisecond, and
**OpenAI** when the deployment is already on OpenAI and one key is
worth more to you than 700 ms at the start of a reply. Reply length no
longer picks between them, which it did while every sentence boundary
cost what the first one did. Each type's own section below has its
options and the details behind its number.

These are one machine on one day from one network, not a benchmark.
Your ratios should hold; your absolute numbers will not. (The
ElevenLabs section quotes ~130 ms from its own earlier measurement,
with a different voice on a different day, which is the size of the
run-to-run variation to expect.)

### ElevenLabs

The reason to reach for the `elevenlabs` TTS type is that it sounds
markedly better than Piper. It needs two things: a key, and a voice
id.

```bash
vinga-server config provider set tts eleven -f - <<'YAML'
type: elevenlabs
voice_id: PUT_YOUR_VOICE_ID_HERE
api_key_env: ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
YAML
```

The key is named, never written. `api_key_env` gives the name of an
environment variable and the server reads it at startup, failing the
boot if it is unset rather than failing every conversation later. A
`.env` file next to the config works, since the server loads one.

The voice id is the id, not the display name, and it is
account-specific even for the stock voices, so an id copied from
someone else's configuration will usually 404. Pick one in the
ElevenLabs app, or list your own:

```bash
curl -s -H "xi-api-key: $ELEVENLABS_API_KEY" \
  https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/voices \
  | jq -r '.voices[] | "\(.voice_id)  \(.name)"'
```

| Option | Default | What it does |
| ------ | ------- | ------------ |
| `voice_id` | required | Which voice speaks |
| `api_key_env` | required | Name of the variable holding the key |
| `model` | `eleven_flash_v2_5` | Flash is the low-latency model (~75 ms to first byte, 32 languages including Swedish). `eleven_multilingual_v2` sounds better and answers slower |
| `output_format` | `pcm_24000` | Must be one of the `pcm_<rate>` formats. The default matches the rate devices are spoken at, so nothing is resampled. `pcm_44100` and up need a paid tier |
| `language_code` | unset | ISO 639-1, pins the spoken language instead of letting the model infer it from the text |
| `voice_settings` | unset | `stability`, `similarity_boost`, `style`, `speed`, `use_speaker_boost`, passed to the API as given |
| `timeout_s` | `30` | Seconds before a synthesis request is abandoned |

Reference for all of it: the [streaming
endpoint](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech/stream),
the [model list](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/overview/models), the
[voice listing
endpoint](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/voices/search), and
what the [voice
settings](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/overview/capabilities/text-to-speech/best-practices)
do to a voice.

**What it costs in latency.** First audio at about 130 to 190 ms
whatever the sentence, which is the fastest of the two cloud types by
a wide margin; see Choosing a voice above for the comparison and what
the numbers mean. An idle conversation pays nothing extra to resume.

**It sends your replies to ElevenLabs**, which is what the reply text
is: the API is billed by character. The type is marked as egress
accordingly, so `server.local_only: true` refuses to boot it (see
Security below). Nothing else in the pipeline moves: VAD, ASR and the
LLM stay wherever you configured them.

### OpenAI

The `openai` TTS type is the one to reach for if the deployment is
already on OpenAI: the same key serves the LLM stage, and the voices
are the stock ones, so there is nothing to pick out of a library.

```bash
vinga-server config provider set tts openai_voice -f - <<'YAML'
type: openai
voice: alloy
api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY
YAML
```

Keys are named, never written, exactly as for ElevenLabs above.

Voices are shared across every account (`alloy`, `ash`, `ballad`,
`coral`, `echo`, `sage`, `shimmer`, `verse`, `marin`, `cedar`), so a
voice copied from someone else's configuration works. Hear them in the
[voice gallery](https://www.openai.fm/).

| Option | Default | What it does |
| ------ | ------- | ------------ |
| `voice` | required | Which voice speaks |
| `api_key_env` | required for OpenAI itself | Name of the variable holding the key |
| `model` | `gpt-4o-mini-tts` | The current speech model, steered in prose, and the fastest of the three to start speaking. `tts-1` and `tts-1-hd` are the older pair |
| `base_url` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | Point it at any server implementing `/v1/audio/speech` |
| `instructions` | unset | How to speak, in prose ("Speak slowly and warmly"). Read by the `gpt-4o` models only |
| `speed` | unset | A multiplier from 0.25 to 4.0. Read by `tts-1` and `tts-1-hd` only |
| `timeout_s` | `30` | Seconds before a synthesis request is abandoned, and a real bound: retries are off |

`base_url` is the same door the `openai_compatible` LLM type opens.
Several self-hosted speech servers implement this endpoint, so a fully
local pipeline stays available through the same dialect, and a keyless
one of those can leave `api_key_env` out; an endpoint that
authenticates still names its variable there, since only OpenAI's own
host makes a key mandatory. It is also what decides whether this type sends
anything off your host, which is why it cannot declare its own egress:
under `server.local_only` the entry carries its own `egress: false` to
assert the endpoint is local, exactly as `openai_compatible` does.

Whether an entry counts as OpenAI is decided by the host, so every
spelling of it (a trailing slash, an explicit port, a different case)
keeps the same startup checks. A `base_url` that is not a URL at all
fails the boot rather than the first synthesis.

Retries are off. The SDK would otherwise attempt a failed request
three times, which inside the serial sentence loop means the device
sits silent for three timeouts plus backoff. A sentence that fails
should fail now and let the conversation move on.

The last two are the one place this type refuses a configuration the
API would accept. Each OpenAI model reads one of them and silently
ignores the other, so naming the wrong one for the model fails the
boot rather than becoming a knob that never takes effect.

That check applies only when `base_url` names OpenAI's host, because
it is a fact about OpenAI's models rather than about the dialect. A compatible
server may name a model `gpt-4o-anything` and read `speed`, or read
`instructions` on a model named nothing like OpenAI's, and its `speed`
need not stop at 4.0. Both knobs are passed through to such an
endpoint unexamined, so it answers for itself.

There is no audio format option, unlike ElevenLabs: the API's `pcm`
format is fixed at 24 kHz, which is the rate devices are spoken at, so
nothing is resampled and there is nothing to choose. Reference for the
rest: the [speech
endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/createSpeech)
and the [text-to-speech
guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech).

**What it costs in latency, and it is the one real drawback.** First
audio arrives at about 820 to 900 ms, roughly +700 ms on ElevenLabs
and +800 ms on Piper: a pause a person notices at the start of every
reply. See Choosing a voice above for the comparison in full.

That cost is now paid once per reply rather than once per sentence.
The server synthesizes the next sentence while the current one is
still playing, so the boundaries inside a reply cost a single frame,
and the stutter that used to make this type unsuitable for an agent
that tells stories is gone. Reply length no longer picks between the
types; the wait before the first word is what does.

Which model you pick matters more here than the option table suggests,
and the default is the fastest of the three by some margin. Worth
stating plainly, because it contradicts how the older pair is usually
described:

Reach for this type because the deployment is already on OpenAI and
one key is worth something. If what you want is the best voice per
millisecond, ElevenLabs is the better buy.

**It sends your replies wherever `base_url` points**, which by default
is OpenAI. See Security below for how `server.local_only` treats it.

## Tools

Beyond speaking, an agent reaches three kinds of tool, merged into one
list the model sees and told apart by the shape of their names.

**MCP servers** are named entries under `mcp_servers`, the way providers
are, and an agent references them through an `mcp` list that
`agent_defaults` can supply. Naming a list replaces the inherited one
rather than extending it, so `mcp: []` is how an agent opts out of tools
its siblings have. Each server's tools are offered under its entry name
(`home__turn_on_light`), which is why an entry name has to be a plain
`[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` name and cannot be `self` or a builtin's name
(`switch_agent`, `remember`, `update_memory`, `forget`,
`restore_memory`, `recall`, `set_state`, `clear_state`,
`new_conversation`, `resume_conversation`). Both transports the
specification defines are supported:

```bash
vinga-server config mcp-server set home -f - <<'YAML'
transport: stdio
command: mcp-proxy
args: ["http://homeassistant.local:8123/mcp_server/sse"]
env:
  API_ACCESS_TOKEN: $HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN
YAML

vinga-server config mcp-server set weather -f - <<'YAML'
transport: streamable_http
url: http://localhost:8000/mcp
headers:
  Authorization: $WEATHER_TOKEN
tool_timeout_s: 15
YAML
```

**SSE-only servers** are reached through a bridge rather than a
transport of their own. Point `mcp-proxy` at the endpoint and configure
the result as the stdio server it now is, which is what the `home` entry
above does:

```yaml
transport: stdio
command: mcp-proxy
args: ["https://example.invalid/mcp_server/sse"]
```

There is no native SSE arm and there will not be one. The specification
moved its HTTP story to streamable HTTP and left SSE deprecated, so a
third transport here would be permanent maintenance for a shrinking
population, bought straight after this server paid to leave one
deprecated client behind. The bridge is one line of configuration and
everything else about the entry, secrets, egress, grants, the timeout,
is the same as any other stdio server's.

**Per-tool grants.** An `mcp` entry is either the entry name on its own,
which is the whole server, or an object naming the server and the tools
of it that layer may reach:

```bash
vinga-server config agent set kids -f - <<'YAML'
prompt: You are the assistant in the kids' room.
mcp:
  - weather
  - server: home
    tools: [turn_on_light, turn_off_light]
YAML
```

The tools are named the way the model is given them minus the entry
prefix (`turn_on_light` for `home__turn_on_light`), which is the name
`vinga-server config mcp-server status` prints, so an operator writes
down the name they read; what the server called the tool before the publishing
rule got to it is never a name this side answers to. Leaving `tools` out
of the object means the whole server, the same as the string form, and
an empty list is refused: "granted, nothing allowed" is a confusing
spelling of `mcp: []`. It is an allow list and there is no deny list,
because a denied set fails open: a kitchen-sink server that adds a tool
would silently grant it to every agent that denied the old ones, which
is exactly wrong on the shared family device the feature exists for. The
same grant is checked again when a call arrives, so a tool an agent was
not offered is refused rather than run if the model asks for it anyway.

An allow list cannot be checked when it is written, since only a live
connection knows what a server publishes. A name that matches nothing is
logged when the server's tools come out of the publishing rule, and
`config mcp-server status` shows each agent's allowed tools beside the
published ones, so the mismatch is answerable in one read. The comparison is
against what published rather than against what the server listed: a
tool dropped for a name collision or for being too long once prefixed is
exactly as unreachable as one that was never offered.

Secrets follow the same rule as everywhere else: a value of `$NAME` is
read from that environment variable at startup, and any secret-looking
key (`token`, `api_key`, `authorization`, ...) must use that form. An
unset variable fails the boot, as does an unknown reference or a
reserved entry name. A server that is merely unreachable does not: it
logs a warning, contributes no tools, and reconnects in the background
when a session that would use it opens.

**Guidance for a server's tools.** A tool's own description says what
it does; how this deployment wants it used is the operator's, and it
belongs beside the server rather than copied into every persona that
was granted it. An entry's `instructions` is that text, injected into
the system prompt of every agent the entry is granted to:

```bash
vinga-server config mcp-server set home -f - <<'YAML'
transport: stdio
command: mcp-proxy
args: ["http://homeassistant.local:8123/mcp_server/sse"]
instructions: |
  The lights, the blinds and the front door are on this server. Turn
  lights on and off freely. Always ask the user to confirm before
  unlocking the door.
YAML
```

It is stored and injected as written, its indentation and its own blank
lines included, and it goes into the prompt under a heading naming the
prefix its tools carry (`home__`), so the model can tie the paragraph to
the names it can call. The only bytes trimmed are whitespace at the two
ends of the whole assembled prompt, and what the surface below reports
is trimmed with them: what it counts is what the model receives.

The grant is the whole condition. Every agent granted the entry is told
about it, whether or not the server is connected and whatever an allow
list narrows its tools to; an agent with `mcp: []` is told none of it.
That means guidance about a tool a particular agent cannot reach is
noise in that agent's prompt, and the answer is to write about the
surface the agents are actually granted, not to expect the server to
work it out. Guidance is whole-entry: an entry whose tools want two
different paragraphs is two entries.

Editing it does not restart the connection, since it is prompt text the
connection never sees, so an apply reports the entry as `unchanged` and
the tools do not blink. What that costs is stated rather than hidden:
the new text reaches a conversation at its **next activation**, a new
session or an agent switch, and a conversation already running keeps
the text it was activated with until it ends. Sessions are minutes
long, so what an edit buys is the next one.

**Guidance the server ships about itself** is a different thing, and it
is off. A server has two channels of its own: the `instructions` of its
handshake, which the specification describes as how to use the server
and its features, and the prompts it publishes. Both are a third party
writing part of your agent's system prompt, so each is an explicit
opt-in on the entry, and there is no way to turn them on for a whole
deployment at once:

```yaml
use_server_instructions: true
inject_prompts: [forecast_style]
```

`use_server_instructions` injects the handshake's text. What a server
ships is captured on every connect whether or not the entry opted in,
so turning it on applies at the next apply with no reconnection, and
turning it off stops the injection while the connection stands.

`inject_prompts` names published prompts, one at a time, by the name
the server lists them under. Wholesale is not offered: the
specification defines prompts as user-controlled templates and a server
may publish dozens, so the operator who read its documentation names
the ones that are standing guidance. The names are checked against the
server's own listing before anything is fetched, and a name it does not
publish, a prompt that declares required arguments, and one that
renders anything but text are each skipped with a warning naming the
entry and the **position in the list**, never the name: a prompt name
is a string the server chose and you copied, so it may hold anything,
and the same is true of every byte of what it publishes. None of it is
ever written to a log. Editing the list changes what a connect fetches,
so applying it does restart the connection.

**One thing is taken back out.** Whatever this deployment gave the
entry in its `env` or `headers` is replaced with `[redacted]` in what
the server ships back, before any of it is stored. Opting in is a
decision about a third party's words, not a decision to let that server
hand your own credential back through a prompt or a gated read, and a
careless server that echoes what it was configured with is the ordinary
case rather than the hostile one. Values shorter than eight characters
are left alone, since an `env` holds ports and locales too.

Both channels are capped at 4000 characters per block, and a longer one
is skipped whole rather than truncated: half an instruction is an
instruction nobody reviewed. What is injected appears under
`server_instructions:<entry>` and `server_prompt:<entry>:<position>` in
the surface below, with a heading in the prompt itself saying the
server is the one talking, so neither you nor the model has to guess
whose words they are. The prompts are re-fetched on every reconnect,
which reaches new sessions and switched-in agents the way an apply's
guidance does.

**The device's own tools** need no configuration. A board whose hello
advertises `features.mcp` is asked for its tools over the same socket
the audio runs on, and they arrive under their firmware names with the
dots replaced (`self_audio_speaker_set_volume`), because both LLM APIs
restrict tool names to `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`.

**Builtins** are `switch_agent`, offered when the device is bound to
more than one agent; the memory family (`remember`, `update_memory`,
`forget`, `restore_memory`, `recall`) and the conversation ledger's
`set_state` and `clear_state`, offered to every agent whose `memory`
section leaves them on, which is every agent that does not say
otherwise; and `new_conversation` and `resume_conversation`, always
offered.

A successful `switch_agent` ends the current agent's reply: the new
agent greets the user in its own prompt and its own voice, on its own
conversation. It does not read what was said to the outgoing agent,
because a conversation is a thread between a user and exactly one agent
and each agent keeps its own; switching back returns an agent to what
it was saying.

`new_conversation` and `resume_conversation` move the session between
threads of the agent that is already speaking, and both need
`server.conversations.resumption` (below). Without it they answer a
fixed sentence saying this server does not keep conversations that can
be picked up again, which the agent reads out, and nothing moves.
`resume_conversation` takes a `description` of what the user is looking
for and answers a short list of the agent's own past conversations to
read out, then takes the one the user picked; only a conversation the
tool has just offered can be resumed, so a model cannot reach a thread
by guessing an id, and never one belonging to another agent. A thread
too long to hand over whole answers with a choice rather than with the
thread, and the third argument, `start_from`, is the user's answer to
it; it is honoured only for the conversation the tool actually asked
about, so a model cannot consent to a recap on the user's behalf.

`remember` keeps one fact, and says which memory it belongs in. Left
alone it is the agent's own, keyed by the agent and not by the device,
because an agent is one entity across rooms: what the kitchen told it
holds in the bedroom. Called with `scope: device` it is the board's,
shared by every agent bound to that board, which is where the room, the
household and the hardware's own quirks belong; what is true of a person
stays with the agent. The scope is steered by the tool's description
rather than enforced, so an assistant that files something in the wrong
place has written a true fact you can move, and the two memories are
separate in every direction: neither is read into the other's block.

The facts live in the `memory` schema of the database this server
already keeps its other two stores in, one row per fact. An agent's
scope holds up to 1000 facts in 64 KiB and a device's up to 30 in 2 KiB,
oldest dropped first, and one fact too long to fit inside its own
scope's budget is refused rather than stored. The insert and the pruning
happen in one transaction under the schema's own writer lock, so two
conversations talking to the same agent at once cannot lose each other's
fact and no reply ever reads a memory that is over its cap. There is
nothing to switch on: the schema is migrated at every boot the way the
record's is, and an agent that has been told nothing gets no memory
block. There is something to switch off, and it is an agent's own
`memory` section, below.

**An agent that is dictated to wants its own endpointer.** Telling an
agent things to remember is slower speech than asking it a question,
and the pauses between clauses run past the 700 ms silence that ends a
turn by default, so the agent answers half a sentence and the rest
arrives as an interruption. The bound is per VAD entry and an agent
binds its own, so give that agent a patient entry rather than slowing
every agent down: see
[Listening and barge-in](#listening-and-barge-in).

**The prompt carries the newest of an agent's facts, not all of them.**
A scope of a thousand facts does not fit in front of a small local
model, so the block is the newest 40 lines within 4 KiB and everything
else is reached with `recall`. A device's notes and the conversation's
ledger are small enough to inject whole.

`recall` looks the facts up: a case-insensitive match on the words
themselves over everything the agent and its device hold, injected or
not, newest first, bounded at 20 lines within 2 KiB with a fixed
sentence when more matched than fits. It is also where the numbers come
from. Every remembered fact has one, `remember` answers with it, the
injected block never shows one, and the number is what the two tools
that change a fact address:

- `update_memory` replaces one fact's words, keeping its number;
- `forget` removes one and answers with the words it removed, which the
  assistant is asked to say out loud so you can ask for it back;
  `restore_memory` brings back the last thing forgotten in the
  conversation, or a named one. A removal is held rather than erased
  until that conversation ends, and `permanently: true` erases outright
  with nothing to bring back.

An assistant reaches its own facts and its device's, and nothing else:
every numbered operation is bounded by ownership in the query itself, so
a number belonging to another agent is answered exactly as a number
belonging to nobody, in one sentence that confirms neither.

`set_state` and `clear_state` keep the other kind: a small ledger of
what is currently true in the conversation happening now, under names
the model chooses, where writing the same name again replaces what it
held. It is what a game's scene and hit points, a board position, or
the step of something in progress belong in, and it is injected as its
own block above the remembered facts, because what is current outranks
what was remembered. It is capped at 4 KiB or 50 entries, and a write
past either is refused with a sentence rather than trimmed silently: a
ledger that dropped entries is a ledger the model cannot trust.

The ledger is keyed by the conversation, not by the connection, so it
survives a device hanging up and comes back when that conversation is
resumed. It is deleted in the same transaction as the thread it belongs
to, whether that thread goes because it was erased through the API or
because retention pruned it, and the deletion answers how much of it
went. On a deployment that does not store conversation text a thread
cannot be resumed at all, so every conversation there begins with an
empty ledger and anything worth keeping has to be remembered instead.

**What has accrued is an operator's to see, and to correct.** Nothing
but this server reads the `memory` schema, so the surface is an
addressed API under `/api/memory` rather than SQL, with `vinga memory`
in front of it. Three questions, in the order they get asked:

```bash
vinga memory list agent                  # who is remembering anything, and how much
vinga memory list agent poet             # what one of them holds, with each fact's number
vinga memory list device aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
vinga memory list conversation <thread>  # what one conversation is currently keeping
```

Correcting one fact reads the corrected text from a file or from
standard input and never from an argument, because what is being
written is something somebody said in a room and arguments land in
shell history and in the process list:

```bash
echo "the user is vegetarian" | vinga memory set agent poet 7
vinga memory set agent poet 7 -f corrected.txt
```

And removing is `vinga memory delete`, which asks before it acts:
`vinga memory delete agent poet 7` for one fact, `--all` for the whole
of one memory, and `vinga memory delete conversation <thread>` reading
the name of one ledger entry from standard input, or `--all` for the
ledger. Every deletion through this door is permanent: the soft
forgetting an agent does belongs to the conversation that spoke it, and
this door is correction and audit rather than that flow.

The listings answer owners nothing is configured under, which is the
point of them rather than an oversight: deleting an agent leaves what it
remembered behind, replacing a board orphans that board's notes, and a
rename leaves whatever a conversation still speaking the old name wrote
before an apply caught up. `--all` is how those rows leave.

**Whether an agent remembers at all is one line of its
configuration.** No builtin is granted the way an MCP server is, and
none needs to be: each of them is either structural or a policy of its
own, and the two are different things.

`switch_agent`'s condition is the device's: it exists exactly when the
board is bound to more than one agent, and withholding it from one of
them would strand a conversation on whichever agent has no way back,
which is the receptionist handoff the tool was written for. The two
conversation tools have no condition, for a reason of their own: a tool
that is simply absent is a tool a model invents, so they are offered
wherever a conversation is and a server that cannot resume anything
says so in a sentence the agent reads out.

The seven memory tools have a policy, which is the `memory` section of
the agent, or of `agent_defaults` for every agent that names none. On
unless it says otherwise, so a deployment that writes nothing has the
memory every agent has always had; off is one field:

```yaml
memory:
  enabled: false
```

Off is the whole family at once, tools and injection together, because
they are one feature seen from two sides: an agent with `remember`
withheld and the block still injected would recall for ever and never
learn, one with the state tools withheld would be read a ledger it had
no way to write, and one with the numbered three withheld could not
correct or take back anything it had been told. So a switched-off agent
is offered none of the seven and is sent none of the blocks, including
the notes its siblings on the same board keep: it can neither write
what the room knows nor read it. Asking for a tool it was not offered
is answered as any name this server does not publish is.

Nothing already stored is deleted by it. The rows stay under the
agent's name, `vinga memory list agent poet` still shows them, and
switching the section back on is an agent that remembers what it
remembered before; `vinga memory delete` is the door that takes rows
away. An apply installs the change at that agent's next utterance, and
one reply never gets half of it: which tools it is offered and what its
prompt carries are decided together, once, at the top of the reply.

A tool that fails, times out, or does not exist comes back to the model
as an error result rather than ending the reply, so the assistant says
what went wrong in its own voice and the user's language. The device
hears silence while a tool runs, bounded by `tool_timeout_s` (15 seconds
by default).

**What a tool answers with is speakable text.** The output of this
pipeline is a voice and its history is text throughout, so text is what
a result contributes. A server that answers with an image, or with
anything else the specification allows, has that part rendered as a
named placeholder (`[unsupported image content]`) rather than dropped:
the model can then say what it was given and that it cannot use it,
which is better than a reply that reads as though the tool was ignored.
The condition for revisiting this is the display: when the device path
can render more than speech, a result can start carrying structured
content to the board, and that work belongs beside the display protocol
rather than inside the tool loop.

### What the model is actually sent

An agent's system prompt is assembled from more than one place now, so
there is a command that says what it adds up to:

```console
$ vinga-server config agent preview house
persona (133 characters)
You are the assistant in the living room. Answer in the language you
were spoken to, and keep answers short: this is spoken out loud.

fragment:household (100 characters)
The bins go out on Tuesday evening, the kitchen speaker is called
Bosse, and the cat is called Ines.

instructions:home (210 characters)
Guidance for using the tools whose names begin with home__:
The lights, the blinds and the front door are on this server. Turn
lights on and off freely. Always ask the user to confirm before
unlocking the door.

server_instructions:home (172 characters)
What the server behind the home__ tools says about using them:
Device names are the ones set in Home Assistant. A scene is turned on
like a light, not called like a script.

memory (108 characters)
You remember these facts about past conversations:
- the user is vegetarian
- the user's dog is called Bosse

total: 731 characters
```

**The order is fixed and documented**, and deliberately not
configurable: the agent's own prompt first, because it says who is
speaking and everything after it is read in that voice; then the shared
fragments it includes, in the order its layer lists them, because they
are standing context the persona speaks within; then the guidance of
each MCP entry the agent is granted, in the order the grants name them,
each under its heading, and within one entry what the operator wrote
first and what the server itself ships after it; then what memory holds
last, which is up to three blocks in the order they take precedence in:
what this conversation is currently keeping, then the remembered facts
under the heading they have always had, then what is known about the
device. Each of those says its own rank in its heading, because the
model is the one reader that cannot see where a line came from, and a
scope holding nothing contributes no block at all. Blocks are
separated by blank lines. One
documented order beats a per-deployment permutation, and it is what lets
a later feature compose against a known base.

**A shared fragment is written once and included by name.** Household
facts, a house style, anything every agent in the deployment should
know: it goes into `prompt_fragments` under a name, and each agent that
should carry it names that fragment in its `prompt_includes`.

```bash
vinga-server config prompt-fragment set household -f examples/prompt-fragment.yaml
vinga-server config agent set house -f agent.yaml   # prompt_includes: [household]
```

The alternative is copying the same paragraph into every persona prompt
and watching the copies drift, which is what this exists to stop.
`prompt_includes` follows the `mcp` list's rules exactly: leaving it out
inherits the `agent_defaults` list, naming a list replaces the inherited
one rather than extending it, and `prompt_includes: []` opts one agent
out of what its siblings share. A name that matches no fragment is
refused when it is written, since the fragment is a row in the same
database. The text is injected as written, with no heading over it: it
is prompt text the operator composed, and a heading would editorialize.
Its indentation and its own blank lines are part of it, and the only
bytes trimmed are whitespace at the two ends of the whole prompt, which
the surface above reports trimmed with them. A fragment is one of the
kinds `vinga-server config apply` installs, so writing or editing one
reaches every agent that includes it at that agent's next activation,
and the write says so.

**Each block is counted** because every one of them competes with the
others for the context budget of a small local model, and there is no
automatic trimming: a server that silently dropped an instruction block
would be worse than one that says what it injected. The number to tune
against is the total, which is the sum of the blocks plus the blank line
between each pair of them: the prompt is the blocks joined and nothing
else, so a character counted here is a character the model receives. Agent activation also logs a `prompt_assembled`
event with the same per-source counts, so a model that degrades in the
field can be diagnosed from the retained logs without reproducing the
session.

**It is a preview of a new session**, not a readback of a running one.
The persona, the fragments and the guidance are assembled when a
conversation starts
and again when it switches agents, and held for the life of that
activation; what memory holds is read on every reply, so a fact stored
by one conversation is known to a concurrent one on its next reply and
a note written in one round is read in the next. So this command
answers what a session opening now would be given, which is what an
operator auditing a configuration wants, and a conversation that
started before the last apply is holding the older text until it ends.

It shows the agent's own memory and no other scope, and that is the
same honesty: what a conversation is keeping and what is known about a
device belong to a session, and a preview that invented a device to
show its notes would be a second assembler pretending to be the first.
The block it shows is the one a reply gets, which is the newest of the
agent's facts rather than all of them; the rest are there, and `recall`
is what reaches them.

Over the API it is `GET /api/runtime/agents/{name}/prompt`, and it is a
read of the running server rather than of the database: the agents this
server is serving, the MCP slice it is running, and the memory it
writes. An agent it is not serving answers 404 naming the apply, since
that is what installs one.

### What the MCP servers are doing

The configuration says what should be running; `vinga-server config
mcp-server status` says what is:

```console
$ vinga-server config mcp-server status
home: connected since 2026-08-13T09:12:03.104213+00:00
  tools: home__turn_on_light, home__turn_off_light, home__unlock_door
  agents: house, kids (turn_on_light, turn_off_light)
weather: down since 2026-08-13T10:41:57.882014+00:00 (ConnectionRefusedError)
  tools: (none)
  agents: house
archive: unused since 2026-08-13T09:12:02.991044+00:00
  tools: (none)
  agents: (none)
```

Three states. **connected** is offering the tools listed under it.
**down** is not, with the reason beside it: the class of the failure, or
`DroppedAfterFailedCall` for a connection dropped after a tool call
failed on it, which is what a server restarting looks like from here. A
down server contributes no tools and is reconnected in the background
when a session that would use it opens, so this is a diagnosis rather
than a chore. **unused** is configured and referenced by no agent, so no
connection was ever built for it: the answer to "why does the agent not
have that tool" when the entry looks right, and invisible everywhere
else.

Each agent under `agents:` is named on its own when it may reach the
whole server, and with its allowed tools in parentheses when it was
granted only some of them. That list sits beside the published one, so
an allowed name the server does not actually offer is answerable in one
read.

It is a read of the running server rather than of the database, which is
why what it says cannot disagree with what is actually connected. Over
the API it is `GET /api/runtime/mcp-servers`, keyed by entry name. The `/runtime`
namespace is separate from the entity namespaces on purpose: an
`mcp_servers` entry may legally be named `status`, and a runtime route
under `/mcp-servers/` would have shadowed it. The CLI's
`mcp-server status` has no such problem and is not an exception to it:
there the word is a verb of the grammar, in the slot a verb is read
from, and an entry name is only ever an argument after one.

The tool lists are published names and nothing else, deliberately: a
description, or the name a server listed before the publishing rule got
to it, is bytes that server chose, and a server holding one of this
deployment's credentials could reflect it in either. Published names
are the exception because the model has to be given them and an
operator has to be able to write one down.

### Applying a change without a restart

A running server serves one immutable snapshot of the domain half at a
time, so writing an entry and granting it to an agent used to cost a
restart and every conversation on the server. `vinga-server config
apply` builds the next snapshot and swaps to it instead:

```console
$ vinga-server config mcp-server set weather -f weather.yaml
wrote mcp-server weather
stored, not serving yet: run `vinga apply` to install it on the
running server, and `vinga diff` to list everything pending.
$ vinga-server config agent set house -f house.yaml
$ vinga-server config apply
mcp:
  connection started: weather
  connection kept: home
prompts:
  changed: house
fillers:
  filled pause kept: house, kids
providers:
  engine kept: asr.ears, llm.local, tts.voice, vad.gate
agents:
  added: house

home: connected since 2026-08-13T09:12:03.104213+00:00
  tools: home__turn_on_light, home__turn_off_light
  agents: house, kids
weather: connected since 2026-08-13T11:02:44.118902+00:00
  tools: weather__forecast
  agents: house
the stored configuration is installed and serving.
```

What it prints is what it did: an outcome with no name under it and a
kind with no outcome are absent rather than listed as empty, and the
words are the ones an operator uses rather than the field names of the
layer that did the work. An apply that moved nothing says so in one
sentence instead. The last line is on stderr, where a fact about this
invocation belongs, and it is the full stop: the command that changes
what the server is serving says that it did. The MCP status block above
it is printed only where there are entries to say something about; how
to configure one is what `mcp-server status` answers. The answer's own
field names are the API's and do not move: `POST
/api/runtime/config/reload` is the same document it was.

**An apply that is refused** says that the stored configuration was
refused and deliberately not where: a sentence composed over stored
state can quote a value somebody wrote into the wrong field, so a
reload's answer never carries one. Where is answered by
`vinga-server config check`, which reads the store the way a boot reads
it and prints the sentence a server started on it would refuse with,
naming the entry and the rule and no value. It runs on the server host,
serves nothing and writes no configuration, though it is not read-only:
a boot's read migrates the store, and this is a boot's read.
[`../docs/reference/cli.md`](../docs/reference/cli.md) is where it is
documented.

`config import` is the other half of the pair rather than a shortcut
past it: it writes a whole deployment to the store in one transaction
and stops there, and this is the command that installs what it wrote.
Two commands rather than one, which is what a rebuild needs anyway,
since a document's credentials go in between them. The per-entity
writes say which boundary they are waiting at for the same reason,
because nothing installs one until somebody asks. The boundary is what
travels between the two halves, as a token: a server ships in an image
and cannot know the grammar of the client somebody has installed beside
it, so it states the boundary, and the client says the whole of it in
its own words wherever it recognizes the set. A boundary the client
cannot name, which is what one from a newer server arrives as, is
answered with the server's sentence quoted instead.

**What it applies** is the whole domain half, re-read from the
configuration database: the `providers` entries and the `mcp_servers`
entries with the secrets stored on them, the agents' effective `mcp`
grant lists (`agents.<name>.mcp` and `agent_defaults.mcp`), the shared
`prompt_fragments`, the agents themselves and the `agent_defaults`
layer under them. An MCP entry that is new or newly referenced is
started, one whose fragment or whose stored secrets changed is stopped
and rebuilt (so rotating a credential applies here too), one that is
gone or no longer referenced is stopped, and an unchanged one keeps the
connection it had, untouched. The MCP outcomes come back with the status
document, so one command both applies and verifies, and the sections for
the kinds a later release will apply are named rather than missing.

An entry whose `instructions` is all that changed keeps the connection
it had (`unchanged` in the answer, a connection kept in the listing),
and that is a statement about the connection: nothing was reconnected,
and the new guidance is what the next activation reads. That is
deliberate. The
text configures a prompt and not a connection, so dropping a live one
to apply it (mid-call tools, a respawned stdio child) would be churn
without a cause.

**Filled pauses are re-synthesized, and only where they had to be.** A
clip is a configured phrase spoken by a configured voice, and the unit
of comparison is the whole effective `filler` section: an apply keeps
every clip whose section and whose voice are what they were, and
synthesizes the rest. So an edit to a prompt sends nothing to a
text-to-speech engine, and neither does an edit to a provider entry no
masked agent speaks through; but an edit to any field of the section
does, `delay_ms` included, even though the
audio that comes back is identical to what it replaced, and so does
rewriting the entry an agent's voice comes from, whose clips are spoken
again in the engine the apply built. That is
deliberate rather than an oversight: the section is one value, and a
comparison that covered part of it would be a second rule about what a
clip depends on. Synthesis is real work at the configured provider, and
may be billed there, so an apply of a deployment with many masked agents
costs what this says it does. The
`fillers` section names each agent under one of three outcomes, and an
agent whose synthesis failed is `disabled`: the apply installed, that
agent runs with the mask off, and the next apply tries again. A
text-to-speech hiccup never holds back a prompt fix.

**The engines are rebuilt, and only the ones that moved.** An entry
whose definition and stored credential are what they were is carried
into the new world as the object it already was, so an edit to a prompt
reloads no local model and rotating one provider's key does not touch
another's. A rewritten entry is built while the old one is still
serving, and the conversations that open after the apply speak through
the new one; one that a conversation is still speaking through is
released when that conversation ends, so applying a change to a local
model briefly holds two of it. The `providers` section names the entries
built, reused and retired. An entry that will not build, or that
`server.local_only` forbids, refuses the apply with nothing changed.

**The agent set moves with the rest.** An agent the store has added is
built with everything else the apply builds and is servable the instant
the request answers, so a device bound to it reaches it at its next
check-in with no restart between the write and the board; an agent it
has deleted is one no session can be opened as from that same instant,
while a conversation already talking as it finishes on the world it was
built from and is served that world's prompt to the end. The `agents`
section names both, and says whether `agent_defaults` moved. The one
thing an agent carries that an apply does not move is its memory, which
is keyed by its name, so the rows stay under the old name. The whole
`server` section (including the configuration file itself) is
start-time as it always was.

**No session is dropped**, and when one meets the change depends on
which half moved. The tools an agent may reach are snapshotted per
reply, so a conversation in progress meets the new tool world on its
next utterance; a tool call in flight on a server the apply stopped
fails into the same error result a server dropping mid-call produces,
which the assistant explains in its own words. Prompt text is assembled
once per activation and cached for it, so a rewritten prompt, fragment
or `instructions` reaches a conversation at its next activation, which
is a new session or an agent switch, and never mid-reply. Filler clips
are bound by a conversation when it opens, so a re-synthesized one
reaches the next conversation rather than changing what an open one is
masking with.

**Nothing is half applied.** The whole new world is composed, validated
and built before anything running is touched, so an unset `$VAR`, a
credential that will not decrypt, an entry `server.local_only` forbids,
or a stored configuration that will not compose into something this
server can serve refuses the apply and leaves it exactly as it was. A
server that merely will not connect is not that: it applies, shows
`down` with its reason, and is reconnected in the background like any
other. One apply runs at a time; a second is refused with the retryable
409 a contended write answers with, having changed nothing.

Over the API it is `POST /api/runtime/config/reload`.

## Stack

Python 3.12 with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com), managed with
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Pydantic models validate both halves
of the configuration, the YAML file and the rows of the Postgres
database behind `vinga-server config` (SQLAlchemy Core over psycopg 3,
Alembic migrations run on open); the same types and the same repository
back the configuration API, of which the command grammar is a client.
Integration tests
drive the server with the [xiaozhi-sdk](https://pypi.org/project/xiaozhi-sdk/)
device simulator, so CI holds real conversations without hardware. The wire
protocol is kept isolated behind a small interface, separate from the
conversation pipeline.

## Development

```bash
# From the repository root: the Postgres both stores live in. The
# server refuses to boot on a database it cannot reach, so this comes
# first, and --wait is what makes "first" mean ready rather than
# started.
docker compose up -d --wait

# The rest, from vinga-server/:
uv sync                             # install dependencies, server half included
uv sync --extra faster-whisper --extra piper  # add the local ASR/TTS engines
uv run vinga-server                # run the server
uv run pytest tests/unit -q         # unit tests
uv run pytest tests/integration -q  # integration tests
uv run ruff check .                 # lint

# What CI runs the unit lane as: distributed over worker processes,
# a file at a time. Reach for it to reproduce a failure that only
# shows up in CI. Local runs are serial by default.
uv run pytest tests/unit -q -n auto --dist loadfile
```

**A Postgres is a prerequisite of running the server at all**, because
every schema it stores its state in lives in one, and the compose service at
the repository root is the development instance. Its defaults are the
server's own defaults (`127.0.0.1:5432`, database `vinga`, role
`vinga`, password `vinga`), so a checkout needs no configuration for
any of it, and the password being shipped in the open is exactly why
the service is published on loopback and nowhere else. Starting it
also runs [`../deploy/postgres-init.sql`](../deploy/postgres-init.sql)
once, which creates the three schemas and the read-only `vinga_ro` role
the conversation record is read through; the tables inside them are
Alembic's, made by the server on its first boot. `docker compose down
-v` throws the whole thing away, and the next `up` rebuilds it from
nothing.

That file also carries the server itself, behind a `server` compose
profile, which is what the project README's quick start starts. The
profile is what keeps the two apart: the command above selects no
profile and so starts the database alone, exactly as it always has,
and `docker compose --profile server up -d --wait` starts the
published image beside it. A checkout that runs the server from source
wants the first; there is nothing to opt out of.

The test lanes use that same instance, and refuse to run rather than
skipping when they cannot reach it, so a suite that has stopped
exercising storage cannot read green. They create databases of their
own to isolate a run, which is why the lane wants a role that may
create them (the compose superuser is one) while the server itself
never needs that privilege.

`uv sync` with no flags is deliberately the whole of it. The package's
default install is the configuration CLI, and the server half is the
`serve` extra; the dev dependency group names that extra, so a checkout
gets a runnable server from one command and there is no tier to
remember. The extras above are the two optional local engines, which is
what an extra flag is still for.

The test lanes run the whole pipeline on the built-in mock providers, so
they need no keys, no model downloads, and no network.

### The local lane: a real conversation

CI never touches real engines. To check the overall work with them, an
opt-in third lane holds one real conversation end to end: it starts a
real server on the fully local pipeline (Silero, faster-whisper, Ollama,
Piper), speaks a Piper-synthesized question through the device simulator,
and asserts the transcript and a coherent spoken reply.

```bash
uv sync --extra faster-whisper --extra piper
VINGA_LOCAL_LANE=1 uv run pytest tests/local -q
```

The run ends with a summary of the conversation it held, so a pass shows
its work rather than a green dot:

```
=========================== local lane conversation ============================
pipeline: silero + faster-whisper small + qwen3:8b + en_US-lessac-medium
question: "What is the capital of Sweden?" (1.6 s of audio)
heard   : "What is the capital of Sweden?" (+1.2 s)
reply   : "The capital of Sweden is Stockholm." (first sentence +3.8 s, 2.0 s of audio)
```

A pre-flight check runs first and fails with the command that fixes
whatever is missing (extras not installed, no Ollama answering, no usable
model). By default it talks to Ollama at `localhost:11434` and prefers
`qwen3:8b`, falling back to the first installed model;
`VINGA_LOCAL_OLLAMA` and `VINGA_LOCAL_LLM_MODEL` override both. The
first run downloads the whisper model and Piper voice at server startup
and can take a few minutes; later runs finish in seconds. Without
`VINGA_LOCAL_LANE=1` the lane skips, so a bare `pytest` stays safe.

### The smoke lane: a conversation with a container

A fourth lane runs nothing itself. It points at a server that is already
up and holds one whole conversation with it: both probes, an OTA check whose
token it verifies, and a full utterance-to-audio exchange through the
device simulator. CI runs it against the image it just built, seeding
that image's own CLI into the database it then reads, which is what
turns "a seeded database and one `docker run` serve a conversation"
into something checked rather than remembered.

Both containers below have to reach the same database, and a container
does not reach the development instance at `127.0.0.1`, since that
address is its own. Join them to the network compose made for it
(`docker network ls` lists it as your project's `_default`) and name
the service instead, which is what `VINGA_DB_HOST` is doing here; CI
does the same thing with a network and a database container of its
own.

```bash
docker build -t vinga-server:local .

# The network compose made for the database, named after the directory
# the compose file is in: `docker network ls` says which it is.
net=vinga_default

# The domain half first, written by the CLI from the image itself into
# the database the server then reads. tests/smoke/seed.sh is what CI runs:
# it starts a server of its own inside this container, configures it over
# loopback, and stops it again, which is why the container gets what a
# server needs.
docker run --rm --network "$net" \
  -e VINGA_AUTH_SECRET=smoke-secret \
  -e VINGA_API_SECRET=smoke-api-token \
  -e VINGA_DB_HOST=postgres \
  -v smoke-data:/data \
  -v "$PWD/tests/smoke:/smoke:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/tests/smoke/config.yaml:/config/config.yaml:ro" \
  --entrypoint sh vinga-server:local /smoke/seed.sh

docker run -d --name vinga-smoke -p 8003:8003 --network "$net" \
  -e VINGA_AUTH_SECRET=smoke-secret \
  -e VINGA_API_SECRET=smoke-api-token \
  -e VINGA_DB_HOST=postgres \
  -v smoke-data:/data \
  -v "$PWD/tests/smoke/config.yaml:/config/config.yaml:ro" \
  vinga-server:local

VINGA_SMOKE_OTA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8003/xiaozhi/ota/ \
VINGA_AUTH_SECRET=smoke-secret \
  uv run pytest tests/smoke -v
```

The secret has to match the one the server under test was started with:
the lane verifies the token it is issued, and that needs the signing key.
It skips without `VINGA_SMOKE_OTA_URL`, so a bare `pytest` stays safe,
and it works against any reachable server, not only a container.

## Configuration

Configuration comes in two halves, kept in two places for one reason:
how the process runs is decided when it is deployed, and what it says
and to whom is decided while it runs.

**The server half is one YAML file.** `server:` (host, port, auth,
onboarding, limits, logging, capture, which database to connect to).
It is passed as
`--config /path/to/config.yaml` or through the `VINGA_CONFIG`
environment variable; with neither set, defaults apply, and it is
handled by
[pydantic-settings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/).
[`../docs/reference/server-config.md`](../docs/reference/server-config.md)
is the complete contract: every key with its type, default, bounds and
description, the environment overrides, and the combinations refused at
boot, generated from the models by `vinga-server config reference
server` and diffed by CI.
[`config.example.yaml`](config.example.yaml) is the annotated starting
point to copy, with a comment per key in its own voice,
and [`config.deploy.example.yaml`](config.deploy.example.yaml) is a
ready-to-adapt profile for the container image behind a proxy on a small
CPU quota, holding values validated by latency measurements from a live
deployment. That profile's domain half is the runnable script beside it,
[`config.deploy.example.sh`](config.deploy.example.sh), which the test
suite runs against a real server, so its measured values are checked
rather than merely written down.

**The domain half lives in a database**, the `domain` schema of the
Postgres database `server.database` names, written with the `vinga`
CLI: named `providers` per stage (`llm`, `asr`, `tts`, `vad`), named
`mcp_servers`, named `prompt_fragments` holding the blocks of prompt
text agents share, `agent_defaults` holding what every agent uses
unless it says otherwise, `agents` combining a prompt with provider,
fragment and MCP references, `devices` binding MAC addresses to agents,
and `default_agent` for unknown devices.

The CLI writes it through the configuration API on the running server,
so these commands need one to be up, and an empty database is a valid
state for it to be up on. `vinga` is that CLI installed as a tool of its
own, which is the ordinary way in: install it on whichever machine
administers this deployment, name the API in `VINGA_API_URL` and carry
the token in `VINGA_API_SECRET`. The image ships the same client under
the server's own entry point, so a shell inside a running container
reaches it with the token and the loopback address already in its
environment, which is the alternative for a deployment that does not
route its API outward.
[`../docs/reference/cli.md`](../docs/reference/cli.md) is the CLI's own
page: installing it, reaching a server, rebuilding one, and every
command's help.

A whole deployment, from an empty database, is one document and two
commands. [`examples/presets/`](examples/presets/) holds two of them, a
deployment that reaches no vendor and the same thing on vendor APIs:

```bash
vinga import -f examples/presets/cloud-stack.yaml
vinga apply
vinga device bind aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff assistant
vinga list
```

Importing orders the writes for you. A write whose references do not
resolve is refused, which is what forces the creation order when
entities are written one at a time; a document is validated against the
state it would leave and written in one transaction, so the providers,
the defaults naming them and the agent inheriting them all arrive
together and nothing is ever half written. Importing is additive and
never deletes, and the same document twice changes nothing. What it
does not do is touch the running server: that is the `apply` on the
second line, which is
[Applying a change without a restart](#applying-a-change-without-a-restart),
and the gap between the two is where a document's credentials go.
[`examples/`](examples/) holds a commented fragment per entity for
writing one at a time with a noun's own `set`, which is what editing a
deployment looks like once it exists.

A board in front of you needs neither its MAC nor that `device bind`
line: `config device pending list` lists what is waiting and `config device pending claim`
binds one by the code on its screen. That is
[Onboarding a device](#onboarding-a-device).

The rules about a runnable server (every stage of every agent
resolving, a default agent when nothing is bound) are checked at boot
rather than at write time, so a half-built database is a legitimate
state to be in and an illegitimate one to serve from.

**When the server will not start**, there is nothing to write through,
and the way back is to rebuild the store rather than to operate on it:
stop the server, delete the database, boot clean, import the export
taken while the deployment was healthy (`import -f`), re-enter the
credentials that export listed, and apply. That is [When the server
will not start](#when-the-server-will-not-start), in the deployment
notes.

Every field of the domain half is documented in
[`../docs/reference/domain-config.md`](../docs/reference/domain-config.md),
generated from the models: `vinga-server config reference` prints that
same document, `vinga-server config reference server` prints the server
half's page beside it, and `vinga-server config schema [entity]` prints
the JSON Schema behind the domain one. The command line itself is
[`../docs/reference/cli.md`](../docs/reference/cli.md), whose command
pages and recipes are generated the same way, by `vinga-server config
cli-reference`. [`examples/`](examples/) holds a commented fragment per
entity and provider type, each naming the command that installs it, and
that is where the measured numbers and the field findings behind each
provider option are kept. `config list` and `config show` read back what
is stored, with every secret masked, and `config export` prints the same
content as a document `config import` takes back.

**The `server` section is what a start reads.** The port, the
directories, the limits and the barge-in tuning come out of the file
this process was launched with, and a change to any of them is picked up
when it is restarted. Nothing in the database is in that half.

**What a running server serves of the domain half is a generation:** an
immutable snapshot, validated whole, built entirely before anything
binds it. There is more than one of them over the life of a process, and
applying a change installs the next one rather than editing the one in
place, so a conversation goes on speaking the world it opened in while
new work binds the world that is current. A change reaches it in one of
two ways, and every mutating command says which.

**The apply installs the domain half, on request.** Writing a provider
entry or an MCP entry, rotating a secret on either, changing which
agents may reach an MCP server, editing a prompt fragment, writing an
agent, deleting one, or rewriting the `agent_defaults` layer under them
all takes effect when a running server is asked to install what is
stored, with no restart and no session dropped: that is [Applying a
change without a restart](#applying-a-change-without-a-restart). Those
writes name `vinga-server config apply`, whose own help says the three
moments a conversation already in progress meets an installed change
at: the tools an agent may reach at its next utterance, its prompt text
at its next activation, and the voice it speaks in and the clips it
masks with at the next conversation. An agent the apply added is one a
device can be bound to
and reach at its next check-in; one it deleted is one no session can be
opened as from the moment the request answers, while a conversation
already talking as it finishes on the world it was built from. The one
thing an agent carries that an apply does not move is its memory, which
is keyed by its name, so the rows stay under the old name.

**Device bindings are the other way, applied by being noticed.** A
running server reads the devices table and the default agent as a device
asks for them, so
binding a board, unbinding it, or changing the default agent applies
at that device's next OTA check or connection, with nothing asked of
the server at all. Those
writes say so instead. That ends where the agent does: a
binding naming an agent this server is not serving resolves to
nothing until the apply that installs it, and the
acknowledgement says that rather than promising otherwise. A
conversation already running is never touched by either.

Since a voice is a `tts` provider entry, two agents that should sound
different reference two entries, and a typical agent is a prompt plus a
voice. `agent_defaults` takes no prompt: a prompt is what makes an agent
that agent. A device is bound to one agent or to a list of them; with a
list, the first entry is the agent a conversation starts on, and the
rest are the ones `switch_agent` can reach.

Every key of the file half can be overridden with a `VINGA_`-prefixed
environment variable, nested keys joined with `__`:
`VINGA_SERVER__PORT=9000`, `VINGA_SERVER__LOG_FORMAT=text`.
Environment variables beat the YAML file, and a `.env` file in the
directory the server is started from is read at startup (real
environment variables beat `.env` too). This layering matches container
deployments: the YAML arrives as a mounted file, overrides and secrets
as environment variables. The domain half has no environment layer: a
`VINGA_` variable naming one of its sections, like a section left in
the file, refuses the boot and names the command that writes it now,
because a configuration that quietly stopped applying is worse than one
that will not start.

**The database is named by four keys and five variables.**
`server.database` carries `host` (`127.0.0.1`), `port` (`5432`), `name`
(`vinga`) and `user` (`vinga`), which are the compose service's own
values, so a checkout says nothing about any of it. Those four have
short environment names of their own, and those are the documented
spellings, because the compose file feeds the Postgres image from the
same four and a fact with two names is a fact with a disagreement
pending:

```bash
VINGA_DB_HOST=db.internal VINGA_DB_NAME=vinga_prod uv run vinga-server
```

The generic `VINGA_SERVER__DATABASE__HOST` spelling would otherwise
work by accident of the nesting scheme, so it is refused instead, with
a sentence naming the short one to use.

Two more variables have no configuration key at all, deliberately.
`VINGA_DB_PASSWORD` is the password, which a file that gets committed,
diffed and printed back is the wrong home for; it defaults to `vinga`
to match the compose service, and that default is a convenience on an
instance bound to loopback rather than anything to deploy on.
`VINGA_DB_URL` is the whole connection at once and wins over the other
five when it is set, accepting `postgresql://` and
`postgresql+psycopg://` and refusing everything else, because a second
storage backend is not a thing this server has.

The server reads all of it at boot, and the config commands read none
of it: they are clients of the API, and where the rows are kept is the
server's business.

**A database the server cannot reach is a boot that refuses**, with a
sentence naming those variables and telling a checkout to run `docker
compose up -d --wait`. It is never a traceback, and it quotes nothing
of the connection back, not even the parts that look harmless: a URL
carries a password in its authority and can carry another in its
query, so none of the five travels into a message or a log line.
Restarting is the orchestrator's job rather than the entrypoint's,
which is why the image waits for nothing and simply says why it
stopped.

### The configuration API

The domain half is read and written over a REST API the server mounts at
`/api` on its own port. It is what `vinga-server config` talks to, and
it is the machine-readable way in for anything else. The contract is the
committed OpenAPI document,
[`../docs/reference/api-openapi.json`](../docs/reference/api-openapi.json):
every route, the schema of every body, and the refusals each route can
answer with. It is generated from the routes themselves by
`vinga-server config openapi` and regenerated by CI, so it cannot drift
from what is served. The API itself serves no interactive docs and no
live schema endpoint; the committed file is the contract.

**Every request carries a bearer token.** The API is always mounted and
there is no flag that turns it off, because an admin surface that can be
switched off by forgetting a key is a surface that ships unprotected.
The token is the value of the environment variable
`server.api.secret_env` names, `VINGA_API_SECRET` by default, and a
server started without it refuses to boot, naming the variable and the
fix:

```bash
VINGA_API_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

Generate it once and keep it where the deployment keeps its other
environment secrets. A request with no token, or with the wrong one, is
answered 401 whichever path it asked for, whether or not that path is a
route: only an authenticated caller gets to learn which routes exist.
One request, for the shape of them:

```bash
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $VINGA_API_SECRET" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8003/api/config
```

**One noun per entity kind**, addressed the way the entity is keyed (a
provider by its stage and its name, a device by its MAC):

```
GET                 /api/config
GET                 /api/providers
GET PUT DELETE      /api/providers/{stage}/{name}
    PUT DELETE      /api/providers/{stage}/{name}/secrets/{slot}
GET                 /api/mcp-servers
GET PUT DELETE      /api/mcp-servers/{name}
    PUT DELETE      /api/mcp-servers/{name}/secrets/{slot}
GET                 /api/agents
GET PUT DELETE      /api/agents/{name}
GET PUT             /api/agent-defaults
GET                 /api/devices
GET PUT DELETE      /api/devices/{mac}
GET PUT DELETE      /api/default-agent
```

**And one namespace that is not about stored configuration at all**,
kept apart from the entity namespaces because an entity may legally be
named after any word a route might want:

```
GET                 /api/runtime/agents/{name}/prompt
GET                 /api/runtime/config/diff
GET                 /api/runtime/mcp-servers
POST                /api/runtime/config/reload
```

The first answers the system prompt a session opening now as that agent
would be sent, block by block with the size of each, which [What the
model is actually sent](#what-the-model-is-actually-sent) describes and
`vinga-server config agent preview` prints. The second answers what the
database holds that this server is not serving, kind by kind: the names
added, removed and changed, and for each kind whether its changes reach
a conversation at the next apply or at a device's
next check-in, which is what makes it possible to say whether a write is
still waiting. It carries entity names and those labels and nothing
else, so a rotated credential shows up as the provider that holds it
being listed as changed. The third answers what each configured MCP
server is doing right now, which [What the MCP servers are
doing](#what-the-mcp-servers-are-doing) describes and `vinga-server
config mcp-server status` prints. The reload route installs what the stored
configuration holds on the running server, which [Applying a change
without a restart](#applying-a-change-without-a-restart) describes and
`vinga-server config apply` prints; it is the only route here that
changes what the server is doing rather than what is stored. The route
keeps the mechanism's name and the command names the act, which is a
deliberate crossing rather than a mismatch.

**And one namespace that reads the conversation record**, the store
[The conversation store](#the-conversation-store) describes:

```
GET DELETE          /api/sessions
GET DELETE          /api/sessions/{session}
GET                 /api/sessions/{session}/turns
GET                 /api/conversations
GET DELETE          /api/conversations/{conversation}
GET                 /api/conversations/{conversation}/turns
```

The first lists the sessions, newest first, filtered by `?device=` when
given. The second is one session whole: its row, with how many turns and
events hang off it. The third is one session's turns, oldest first, each
carrying its numbers and the tool calls it made nested in the order the
model issued them. The list and the timeline page on the monotonic row
ids the store was built with; the detail read is one session and takes
neither argument. `?limit=` holds 50 rows by default and 200 at most,
and `?cursor=` is a row id this API answered with, meaning the sessions
before it in the listing and the turns after it in a timeline, which is
the direction a client that has read up to a turn asks in. A page
answers `{"items": [...], "next_cursor": <id or null>}`, and the cursor
is null when there was nothing beyond that page. The conversations
rows are the same record read as threads: the list orders by a
conversation's last activity, filtered by `?agent=` when given, and
pages on the pair `?cursor_active=` and `?cursor_id=` this API
answered with, together or not at all, because an activity ordering
moves and a row id alone cannot page it; the detail is one thread with
its milestone count; the turns are its dialogue oldest first, across
every session it spanned. The three DELETE rows are the erasure verbs
[Deleting on demand](#the-conversation-store) below describes: one
named session, the selector purge (`?session=`, `?device=`,
`?before=`, at least one, combined with AND), and one named thread.
A deployment that never
recorded answers 404 naming `server.conversations.enabled`; one that
recorded and has since switched recording off still serves what it
recorded. The events themselves are deliberately not served here: the
database is that surface, and there is no analysis endpoint for the same
reason there is no analysis command.

`GET /api/config` is the whole domain configuration, masked, with the
location of every stored secret beside it, which is the JSON of what
`config show` prints. Every other read answers with the entity's masked
body and the slots holding a secret stored in the database, each marked
with the entity key its value displaces, which is the one thing a masked
entity cannot carry itself. A read is masked always, and a stored secret
is never read back by any route.

A PUT is create-or-replace, the CLI's `set`: the body is the same
fragment, as JSON rather than YAML, every reference it names has to
exist already, and the entity's stored secrets are left alone. A secret
is written by PUTting `{"secret": "..."}` to its slot, which is the only
plaintext this API accepts and the reason the whole of it belongs on a
loopback connection or behind TLS. Three writes take an argument rather
than a fragment: that one, a device binding (`{"agents": [...]}`), and
the default agent (`{"name": "..."}`), whose DELETE clears it.

**A successful write says when it takes effect.** It answers
`{"wrote": "...", "notice": "...", "applies": [...]}`: a sentence for a
reader, and the boundaries it is waiting at as the closed tokens the
comparison read publishes, which is the half a program branches on. A
device binding and the default agent carry the one about a device
asking, because a running server reads them as it asks: they apply at
that device's next OTA check or connection. Every other kind this API
writes, which is the whole of the rest of the domain half, carries the
one that says the write is stored and not yet serving, and leaves the
three moments a conversation meets an installed change at to the
installing command's own help. A binding naming an agent this server is
not serving yet carries a sentence of its own, and it is the one an
operator is most likely to need, because both halves of it are true at
once: the row is live, and the agent arrives at the apply that installs
it. A default agent naming an unserved agent carries its own for the
same pair of reasons and about the row it really wrote, which covers
every device that has no binding of its own. No sentence names a
command: which command crosses a boundary is a fact of the client's
grammar, and a client is a program this server neither ships nor
versions, so the CLI reads the tokens and says the whole of it in its
own words where it knows the set, and quotes the sentence where it does
not. Nothing about a running conversation changes when a write lands,
in any of these cases.

**A refusal is an RFC 9457 problem document**, served as
`application/problem+json`, and carries the sentence the CLI prints in
`detail`, with a status code: 404 for an entity that does not exist,
409 for the retryable busy database lock or a reload already running
(nothing was changed, so retry), 422 for a fragment or an address the
caller got wrong, 500 for stored state that cannot be read, and 503 for
a runtime action asked of an application with no server around it.
Beside `detail` are the status's standard reason phrase as `title`, the
status repeated, and `errors`: one `{path, message}` entry per field of
the submitted fragment the refusal names, `path` an RFC 6901 JSON
Pointer into it, so a form can mark the offending field rather than
quote the paragraph. `errors` is always present and empty where the
refusal names no field. A request body is never quoted back, on any
path, and neither is a traceback: a fragment can carry a credential
pasted where a variable name belongs, and a refusal that echoed it
would be the leak. **Neither are its keys.** A refusal names only fields
this server declares and positions in a list; a key the request invented
(an unrecognized one, an option a provider passes through, an entry of
an `env` or `headers` map) is as good a place to paste a credential as a
value is, so a refusal about one says which rule it broke and points at
the nearest enclosing place this server can name.

**`vinga-server config` is the ergonomic client**, and the shape of a
deployment's own use of the API. It finds the server in this order:

1. `--api-url`
2. `VINGA_API_URL`
3. `http://127.0.0.1:<server.port>/api`, the port read from the same
   YAML file the server was started with (`--config`, or
   `VINGA_CONFIG`), so the two cannot disagree about it

The token is the value of the variable `server.api.secret_env` names,
read from that same file, and a missing one is a sentence naming the
variable before any request is sent. On a deployment both fall out for
free: exec into the running container, and the token variable and the
loopback address are already in the environment. That is the intended
way to run these commands.

The token grants everything the API can do, so the client refuses a
plain `http://` connection to a host that is not a loopback address
(`127.0.0.1`, `::1` or `localhost`), and there is deliberately no flag
to override it: such a flag's only purpose would be
sending the token in clear. A URL carrying a username or a password is
refused outright, and any URL the client prints has that stripped. Its
timeouts are explicit (5 s to connect, 30 s to read) so that the
server's own retryable answer, which can take up to the database's ten
second lock timeout to arrive, reaches you as itself rather than as a
transport error. `import` is the exception, and deliberately: its
transaction loads the whole existing configuration and validates the
whole resulting one, whose size no request bound limits, so it waits for
the answer however long that takes rather than giving up on a write the
server may be about to commit. `apply` is a command of its own and
carries its own sixty seconds, because a bound belongs to the endpoint
rather than to the command that reached it.

The whole command line, including installing it away from a deployment
and every command's own help page, is
[`../docs/reference/cli.md`](../docs/reference/cli.md).

**There is no second way in.** Every command here is a request, so a
deployment whose server will not start is recovered by rebuilding its
store rather than by editing it: stop the server, delete the database,
boot clean, import a kept `config export` with `config import`,
re-enter each stored credential through the `secret set` commands that
export listed at its foot, and `config apply` to install what came
back. The full procedure is in the deployment notes, under
[When the server will not start](#when-the-server-will-not-start).

### Secrets

A credential is never written in the configuration, in either half. Two
forms are supported:

- **An environment reference**, which is the only form a fragment may
  carry: a provider names the variable holding its key (`api_key_env:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), an MCP server writes `$NAME` where the secret
  goes. The server reads the variable at startup and fails the boot when
  it is unset, rather than failing every conversation later.
- **A value encrypted in the database**, written with a noun's own
  `secret set`, which reads it from stdin (not echoed at a terminal) or
  from a named variable with `--from-env`, and never from an argument:

  ```bash
  vinga-server config provider secret set llm claude api_key
  ```

  Encryption uses `VINGA_MASTER_KEY`, one or more Fernet keys, newest
  first, comma separated. Generate one with:

  ```bash
  python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
  ```

  A stored secret takes precedence over an environment reference for the
  same slot, and `config show` marks the reference it displaces. With
  ciphertext stored and no key configured, or a key that does not open
  it, the server refuses to start naming the entity and the slot, and
  the API goes down with it, so the repair is the rebuild above: boot on
  an empty database and put the configuration back, entering each
  credential again under a key that works. A slot whose value is gone
  for good is left to its environment reference by writing the entity
  without the stored one.

Instance configs stay out of the repository; `*.local.yaml` and `.env`
are gitignored for local experiments, and the domain half of a local
experiment is a short script of `config <noun> set` calls against a
database of its own, which `VINGA_DB_NAME` is enough to give it.

## Security

**Which hosts a configuration reaches.** Worth reading before deploying
anywhere with an egress allowlist, because a blocked host does not
announce itself: the server boots healthy, other stages keep working,
and the blocked stage waits out its `timeout_s` while the device plays
silence.

| Configured as | Reaches | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `llm: anthropic` | `api.anthropic.com` | |
| `llm: openai_compatible` | whatever `base_url` names | `api.openai.com` when pointed at OpenAI, a host on your own network when pointed at Ollama or vLLM |
| `asr: openai` | `api.openai.com` by default, else `base_url` | **Shares its host with an OpenAI LLM.** Adding cloud ASR to a deployment already using OpenAI for the LLM needs no new host |
| `tts: openai` | `api.openai.com` by default, else `base_url` | Same |
| `tts: elevenlabs` | `api.elevenlabs.io` | A separate host, and the one most likely to be missed |
| `asr: faster_whisper` | `huggingface.co` at first start only | Model weights, downloaded once into `/data` |
| `tts: piper` | the voice collection at first start only | Same |
| `vad: silero` | nothing | Weights ship with the package |
| `mcp_servers` (`streamable_http`) | whatever the entry's `url` names | Each entry is its own host |
| `mcp_servers` (`stdio`) | wherever the command it runs goes | Not knowable from the configuration |

The two local engines are the only entries that reach anything at
startup and then stop, which is why a deployment that has been running
for months can still be broken by an egress rule: nothing re-reaches
those hosts until the volume is cleared.

**Devices authenticate, by default.** The OTA endpoint issues each device
a token, the firmware persists it to NVS, and the WebSocket handshake
checks it before accepting the upgrade. A connection with no token, a
forged one, an expired one, or one issued for a different device is
refused with HTTP 403 on the upgrade, which stock firmware handles by
retrying and picking up a fresh token at its next OTA check.

The token is upstream's scheme, `sig.ts`, where `sig` is HMAC-SHA256 over
`client_id|device_id|ts`. It is stateless: a restart does not lock out
every device holding a persisted token. Statelessness also means any
process sharing the secret accepts another's tokens, but that is a
property of the scheme rather than support for a second replica; the
supported topology is one server process (see
[Running in a container](#running-in-a-container)).

The secret comes from the environment, never from the config file:

```bash
VINGA_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

Generate it once and keep it. Changing the secret invalidates the token
every device has stored, and a device only refreshes at its next OTA
check, which it makes on boot: until then it is refused at the handshake
and plays an error tone with nothing on its screen. That is the intended
behaviour of a rotated secret, but it is worth doing deliberately rather
than by regenerating one inside a `docker run` you repeat.

**A missing secret fails the boot.** Authentication is enabled by default,
and starting with it enabled and no secret refuses to come up, naming the
variable and the fix. A deployment that forgot its secret must not look
exactly like a working one. For a trial on a network you trust, opting
out is one deliberate flag:

```yaml
server:
  auth:
    enabled: false
```

or `VINGA_SERVER__AUTH__ENABLED=false` in the environment.

**Who gets a token is the allowlist.** A token is only issued to a device
the configuration resolves to at least one agent. Omit `default_agent`
and the `devices` map becomes an allowlist: an unknown MAC is issued
nothing and turned away. There is no second list to keep in sync.

**The OTA endpoint is the token issuer, so it cannot require a token.**
What protects it instead is stingy issuance and a path you choose. It is
served at two of them, and both are the same handler:

- `/x/<key>/`, the short path an operator types into a board's captive
  portal, where the key is eight base32 characters derived from the
  device-auth secret. Derived, so nothing configures or stores it, it
  survives restarts, and it changes only when that secret does. With
  device authentication off there is no secret to derive from and the
  route is served keyless at `/x/`.
- `server.ota_path`, the legacy full path, for boards already carrying
  one in NVS. Exposed publicly it should be a long random segment
  (`openssl rand -hex 8`), and it is nullable, so a deployment whose
  boards have all been onboarded through the short path can unmount it:

  ```yaml
  server:
    ota_path: /xiaozhi/ota/8f3a9c2b1d4e5f60/   # or null to unmount
  ```

The two segments are treated differently on purpose. The derived key is
printed at startup and repeated in the log line a wrong key produces,
which is what makes a typo and a rotated secret diagnose themselves; it
is a deployment-scoped path segment rather than a per-device
credential, and that trade is deliberate and recorded. The `ota_path`
segment is never printed anywhere, and neither is any device token.

The WebSocket path never moves: the token is what protects it.

**Nothing else is exposed.** `/x/<key>/`, `/xiaozhi/ota/` (or wherever
you put it), each with an `activate` beneath it that a waiting board
polls, `/xiaozhi/v1/`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and the configuration API under
`/api/`, which answers 401 to anything not carrying its bearer token. FastAPI's
`/docs`, `/redoc`, and `/openapi.json` are turned off on both
applications, and `server.ota_path` refuses a path under `/api/`: the
OTA route is registered before the API is mounted, so it would be found
first and would answer a request the token gate never saw.

**Fully local is checked, not hoped for.** This section is how the
server keeps
[the first-class local deployment](../docs/architecture/product-promises.md#a-fully-local-deployment-is-first-class),
which is where the commitment itself is written down.
Every provider type declares
whether it sends session data (audio, transcripts, replies) off the
host, and with `server.local_only: true` the server refuses to boot any
provider that does, naming the stage and provider. The local engines
(Silero, faster-whisper, Piper) pass; an `anthropic` or `elevenlabs`
entry fails. The three `base_url` types, `openai_compatible` for the
LLM stage and `openai` for both ASR and TTS, can each point at
localhost or at a cloud vendor, so under `local_only` they must carry
your own declaration:

```bash
vinga-server config provider set llm local -f - <<'YAML'
type: openai_compatible
base_url: http://localhost:11434/v1
model: qwen3:8b
# Your assertion that this endpoint stays on this host.
egress: false
YAML
```

MCP servers sit inside the same boundary, because tool arguments carry
conversation-derived data. No transport can know where they end up (a
stdio command may proxy anywhere, a URL may name localhost), so under
`local_only` every MCP server an agent references must carry the same
`egress: false` declaration, asserting that whatever its command or URL
reaches stays on your own network.

The checks run at boot, never at request time: a local_only server that
starts is a local_only server, and a config edit that would break the
promise stops the server from coming up instead of quietly shipping
audio to a vendor.

**Memory is stored on the host and read out to the model.** What an
agent remembers, what a device's notes hold and what a conversation is
keeping never leave this deployment as storage: they are rows in the
database it already owns, they travel in the same `pg_dump` as
everything else, and no other server is told about them. But they are
injected into the system prompt on every reply, and `recall` answers a
model with more of them on demand, which makes them prompt content: they
follow the active LLM provider's egress like the transcript and the
persona do, so an agent on a cloud model sends what it remembered along
with what was just said. The device scope is worth stating on its own: a
note about the room or the household is shared by every agent bound to
that board that may remember, so it reaches every one of their providers
rather than only the provider of the agent that was told it. An agent
whose `memory` section is off is read none of it and sends none of it,
which is the one lever that narrows this. `server.local_only` is the
guard, and it is the same guard: a provider that sends session data off
the host cannot be booted under it, and memory rides the boundary that
draws.

## Listening and barge-in

The firmware decides how it listens and the server follows. In `auto`
mode the device shuts its microphone off while a reply plays and sends a
fresh `listen start` afterwards. In `realtime` mode, which it picks when
its echo cancellation is on, it streams continuously and asks only once,
so the session here never stops listening: an utterance that ends while
a reply is playing cancels that reply and is answered instead. Talking
over the assistant stops it, which is what barge-in means.

```yaml
server:
  barge_in: true               # speech during a reply interrupts it
  barge_in_min_speech_ms: 500  # least classified speech that may interrupt
```

Turn it off for a board whose echo cancellation leaks the speaker back
into the microphone, typically a single-mic board, where a reply would
otherwise interrupt itself. Conversations stay multi-turn with it off;
only the interrupting goes. What says a board wants it: replies that
answer nothing at all, arriving just after the previous reply finished
speaking.

An interruption the endpointer hears is gated before it may cancel: a
reply is only cancelled on evidence of user speech. Speech shorter than
`barge_in_min_speech_ms` is a noise blip and never interrupts. Past
that floor, the reply pauses while ASR transcribes the interruption,
and only a non-empty transcript cancels; an empty one resumes the reply
where it stopped, about one ASR pass later. An interruption landing
while the reply is still transcribing merges with what it interrupted
instead, so one reply answers the whole sentence. Nothing is dropped
for arriving early in the playback: a refractory window used to do
that, and it turned out to catch only users finishing their own
sentence, since half a second of classified speech cannot come out of
the fraction of a second of reply the room has heard by then.
Every one of these decisions is a structured log event, which is what
the threshold is tuned from. A manual `listen stop` mid-reply is the
user holding the button and speaking, so it cancels unconditionally.

**Where a turn ends is one number, and it belongs to the agent rather
than to the server.** The endpointer ends an utterance after
`trailing_silence_ms` of silence, 700 ms by default, which is the right
bound for question-and-answer speech. Dictation is slower: telling an
agent things to remember pauses between clauses for longer than that,
so the turn ends mid-sentence, the reply answers a fragment, and the
rest of the sentence arrives as an interruption to it. Raising the
bound for the whole server would put the added latency on every turn of
every agent to fix one agent's usage pattern, and there is no need to.
The bound is an option on the VAD provider entry, and an agent binds
the entry it wants:

```yaml
providers:
  vad:
    quick:
      type: silero
    patient:
      type: silero
      trailing_silence_ms: 1200

agents:
  quizmaster:
    vad: quick
  archivist:
    vad: patient
```

Each agent's endpointer is built from the entry that agent binds, and a
handover mid-conversation builds a fresh one from the incoming agent's,
so the two agents above listen differently inside the same session.
What a longer bound cannot do is tell a thinking pause from a finished
sentence: every pause costs its full length before the reply starts,
which is why this is per agent rather than raised everywhere, and why
reading more than silence is its own piece of work
([end-of-turn detection](../docs/glossary.md#end-of-turn-detection)).

## Masking reply latency

The silence between the end of an utterance and the first audio of the
reply is where the assistant feels dead: healthy field turns run 1.5
to 3 s of it, and a slow provider stretches it well past the point
where users ask "are you there?". Humans hold exactly this gap with a
filled pause, and an agent can too:

```bash
vinga-server config agent-defaults set -f - <<'YAML'
filler:
  # off by default
  enabled: true
  delay_ms: 1800
  phrases:
    - "Hmm, let me see..."
    - "Good question..."
YAML
```

When a reply's first audio has not started within `delay_ms` of the
utterance being transcribed, the session plays one of the phrases,
rotating through them, and the real reply queues behind the clip's
tail. The clips are synthesized ahead of time in each agent's own voice
and cached as PCM, never at fire time: synthesis at the moment of
masking would add TTS latency to the exact gap being masked, and a
cached clip keeps working when the TTS provider is the thing being
slow. Ahead of time is the server start and every `vinga-server config
apply` after it, which re-synthesizes the agents whose effective
`filler` section or whose voice moved, whichever field of the section it
was, and hands the result to the next conversation; one already open
keeps the clips it opened with. A synthesis failure logs a
warning and leaves the feature off for that agent rather than failing
the boot or refusing the apply.

The filler is honest assistant speech: it moves the device into its
speaking state, counts as the turn's `speaking_started`, lands on
capture channel 1, and enters the barge-in gates like any reply audio,
so talking over it interrupts the reply, which is the correct reading.
One filler per turn, logged as a `filler_played` event; a turn that
outlives both the filler and the first-token watchdog resolves through
the watchdog's give-up path (see below), the filler being the soft
early threshold and the watchdog the hard late one. Write the phrases
in each agent's own language; an agent's own `filler` section replaces
the inherited one wholly, like the stage fields, and the reasoning
behind the default delay is in
[`examples/agent-defaults.yaml`](examples/agent-defaults.yaml).

The mask yields to the user. At fire time the timer stands down, with
a `filler_skipped` event, when the endpointer holds unresolved speech
or a barge-in confirmation has the outgoing frames paused. Both mean
the turn ended at a premature endpoint and the user is already mid
continuation: the reply in flight is about to be cancelled, and a
clip played into that would talk over them (field round 2 measured
exactly this on dictation-style turns). The skip consumes no phrase,
and the reply that answers the completed sentence arms its own timer.

## When a reply fails

The other end of the same turn. A reply that fails outright, on a
provider that is down or a model that never answers, used to be
silence: the failure was logged and nothing reached the speaker or the
display, so from the couch a broken pipeline and a slow one were the
same turn. Every agent therefore has a fixed phrase for it, cached the
same way the filled pauses above are:

```bash
vinga-server config agent-defaults set -f - <<'YAML'
fallback:
  # on by default
  enabled: true
  phrase: "I ran into a problem and could not answer. The server log has the details."
YAML
```

It is spoken and shown: the sentence goes out as a `tts sentence_start`,
so it renders on the display, and the cached clip follows it, so it is
heard. It is vinga's own words rather than the agent's, and it goes no
further than that turn: it never enters the reply's spoken sentences,
the conversation history or the stored conversation, and `replied`
keeps its meaning of model speech that went out. What says it happened
is a `reply_fallback` event, carrying the reason and whether the phrase
was heard as well as shown, never the words themselves. The phrase is
fixed configuration and is never the failure's own message, which
arrives from the far side of a network and is not this server's to
speak.

Only a terminal failure speaks. A device that went away is told
nothing, because there is nobody left to tell, and a reply cancelled by
a barge-in says nothing either, because a cancellation means the user
is talking. Neither reads the section.

**This one is on by default, unlike the filler above.** The silent turn
is at its worst during onboarding, where a misconfiguration is
likeliest and nobody has a log open, so a deployment that would rather
have silence is the one that says so: `fallback: {enabled: false}`, on
`agent_defaults` or on a single agent. Being on by default has a cost
worth knowing, and it is per start rather than per upgrade: **every**
server start synthesizes one short phrase for every agent that has not
switched the section off, through the configured TTS provider, before
the server begins serving. That is one provider call per agent, a few
seconds of startup, and, on a metered voice, a few seconds of billed
synthesis, paid again at every restart, redeploy and container
replacement. Nothing is cached across processes: a start has no previous
world to keep a clip from. What reuse there is lives inside one running
process, across `vinga apply`: an agent whose `fallback` section and
whose voice are both unchanged keeps the clip it already had, and each
of the two kinds of clip is re-synthesized only when its own section or
its voice moves, so applying a prompt edit costs no synthesis at all.
Synthesis is bounded per phrase, so a provider that hangs delays a start
by seconds rather than indefinitely; a phrase that will not synthesize
in time, or at all, degrades to the display alone, with a
`fallback_degraded` event naming the agent. That turn still shows the
sentence and still closes with its `tts stop`, and only the audio is
lost.

## When a model writes a tool call into its speech

A reply is spoken sentence by sentence, and every sentence is spoken
except one kind: a sentence shaped like a call to a tool this reply
actually offered. Some models, small local ones especially, write their
calls out as ordinary prose instead of issuing them, and read aloud
that is JSON in the assistant's voice on the one user-facing surface
with no filter on what a model produced.

The check is narrow, and it is anchored to the tools of the reply it is
in rather than to "looks like JSON": someone asking an agent to explain
a JSON snippet is a real conversation and gets an answer. A sentence is
withheld when it contains a complete JSON object that either names one
of the offered tools, in its own `name` or in the `name` under a
`function` key, or whose keys all fall inside the properties one
offered tool declared. The second is the shape the field actually
produces, where the name never made it out and only the arguments did
(`{"volume":"100"}`), so nothing about it can be matched by name; keys
are compared and values never are, since the observed one had the wrong
type for the schema it belonged to.

The sentence goes whole and the reply carries on. It is not spoken, not
shown, not added to the conversation this server keeps, and not stored,
and no event or log line carries a byte of it: what says it happened is
a `sentence_withheld` event, carrying its length in characters and
which tool it was shaped like, under the same naming rule `tool_call`
follows. A reply left with nothing at all to say, every sentence of it
withheld, says the fallback phrase above with the reason
`nothing_sayable`, because the alternative is the silence that phrase
exists to end.

**One bound, stated rather than hidden.** The test is on each sentence
as it arrives, because a sentence has already been handed to the voice
by then. Sentences are cut at newlines, so a pretty-printed call
arrives as a handful of fragments no JSON decoder can read, and those
fragments are spoken. Closing that would mean holding sentences back to
see what follows them, which puts a stall in front of live speech at
every ordinary `{` in every reply. The residue is left visible through
the event instead: an operator seeing `sentence_withheld` repeatedly,
or hearing the fragments, is reading a fact about the model this
deployment configured. The same event is what makes the cost of the
key-matching rule visible, since an agent reading out a JSON example
whose keys mirror an offered tool is withheld too.

## Limits

Three numbers bound what one server holds, and none is visible in normal
use: a device refused a slot, or closed by either time bound, reconnects
on its next wake word.

```yaml
server:
  limits:
    # concurrent conversations
    max_sessions: 8
    # one session's maximum life
    max_session_s: 3600
    # how long a realtime session may go without conversing
    idle_timeout_s: 120
  drain_s: 20             # how long a shutdown waits for replies to finish
```

`idle_timeout_s` is the one users actually meet. A realtime device asks
to listen once and then streams its mic for the rest of the connection,
and nothing in the firmware ever closes that channel, so walking away
mid-conversation used to leave a mic running until the hour was up. The
clock counts from the end of the last utterance or the end of the last
reply, whichever is later; arriving audio does not reset it, because a
realtime session streams silence too. Two minutes by default: long
enough to think, read something out, or answer the door.

It applies to realtime sessions only. An auto-mode device stops
listening after each reply and re-arms per turn, so it is not streaming
a room to anybody, and `max_session_s` is its bound. There is no off
switch; a deployment that wants none sets `idle_timeout_s` near
`max_session_s`.

`max_sessions` is a count with no queue behind it, because a
conversation waiting in line is worse than one that never started.

**Shutting down drains.** On SIGTERM the server stops admitting sessions,
lets every reply in flight finish speaking, and closes those sockets with
1001, all inside `drain_s`. A second signal forces the exit. Give
`docker stop` a `-t` above `drain_s`; its default is ten seconds.

`drain_s` is the whole budget a reply gets, so raise it if your replies
are long: a spoken answer is paced at the frame rate, so thirty seconds
of speech takes thirty seconds to deliver. When a reply outlasts the
budget its socket is still closed politely, but the drain logs
`drain_incomplete` with `cut_mid_reply`, which is the signal that
`drain_s` is too short for the replies this server gives.

**Two probes, and which one to point at what.** `/healthz` is liveness:
this process is alive and serving its control surface. `/readyz` is
admission: this process may be handed a new device conversation. An
orchestrator with two probe slots points restart at `/healthz` and
traffic admission at `/readyz`. A draining server answers 200 on the
first and 503 on the second, which is exactly what a redeploy wants: the
pod is left running to finish the conversations it has, and no new device
is sent to it. Both are unauthenticated, and neither says anything about
a provider or an MCP server.

`/readyz` answers `200 {"status": "ok"}`, or 503 with one word for why
not:

| Status | What it means |
| ------ | ------------- |
| `ok` | serving, and there is room for another conversation |
| `draining` | shutting down: what is in flight is finishing, and nothing new is admitted |
| `full` | every one of the `max_sessions` slots is taken |
| `unavailable` | there is no serving composition to admit anything to |

Readiness dips at capacity and recovers as slots free. That is what
readiness is for rather than a flap: a device refused a slot retries on
its own next wake word, and an orchestrator withholding new traffic from
a full pod is precisely the behavior being asked for. The cost is worth
knowing when sizing `max_sessions`, though: under an orchestrator that
routes by readiness, a full pod's configuration API leaves the traffic
set along with its WebSocket.

`unavailable` is narrower than it sounds. Uvicorn binds its listener only
once the lifespan's startup has finished, and that startup is what builds
the composition (a provider loading a model can hold it for minutes), so
a probe against a starting server meets a connection failure rather than
this answer, and every prober treats that as not ready. What answers
`unavailable` is an application that was described and never served, and
one whose shutdown has already released what it was serving with.

The image's own `HEALTHCHECK` is `/healthz`, deliberately. Docker has one
health slot and it is not a restart trigger: an unhealthy container is
surfaced and gated on (`--wait`, `depends_on: service_healthy`) rather
than replaced, so a container going unhealthy while it drains would turn
every redeploy into a reported failure.

**A stalled generation is retried, then dropped.** An LLM whose stream
shows no sign of life within `llm_first_token_timeout_s` (ten seconds
by default) has its request cancelled and the round retried once,
logged as `llm_retry`; a second stall gives the round up as a
`provider_failed` with `error: FirstTokenTimeout` and the session goes
back to listening, so the worst a stalled provider can cost is one
turn, and that turn says so out loud (see [When a reply
fails](#when-a-reply-fails)) rather than passing in silence. Only the
wait for the stream to begin is bounded: a long reply that is already
streaming runs to the end, a round that streams nothing but a tool call
counts as delivering too, and barging in still cancels a stalled round
the way it cancels anything else. The default is worth raising for one
case in particular: a local model served by Ollama or llama.cpp loads
its weights on the first request after a cold start, which routinely
takes longer than ten seconds on a machine that has just booted or has
evicted the model, so the first turn of the day gives up before the
model has finished loading. Keeping the model resident, or raising this
value on a deployment that runs one locally, is the remedy. The
reasoning behind the default is in `config.example.yaml`.

## Logging

Two formats, one handler:

```yaml
server:
  log_format: text   # or json, which is the container image's default
  log_level: INFO
```

Every event is logged as a human sentence and, in `json` mode, as a line
of structured fields. Every record carries `event`; the ones a
conversation emits, on the `vinga_server.session` channel, carry
`session` and `device` beside it, and the server's own channels carry
either only where the record is about one.

Which fields an event carries, which tokens a reason field admits, what
each of them is held to and which sentence it renders are the generated
[event schema reference](../docs/reference/events.md), one section per
event and one subsection per shape it may be emitted in. It is generated
from the declarations themselves, so it cannot say anything they do not.
This index is the other half: what exists, and when it fires.

| `event` | when |
| --- | --- |
| `ota_check` | a device checks in (no session yet, so the record names the device) |
| `ota_check_body` | the whole of what a board reported at that check-in, at DEBUG, so `vinga events tail --level DEBUG` is how somebody asks for it |
| `activation_not_offered` | an unbound device is answered with no activation code, and why |
| `activation_complete` | a waiting device has been claimed; its next check hands it a token |
| `activation_pending` | a waiting device polls and is still waiting |
| `activation_refused` | a version-2 activation poll fails one of the checks this server can hold it to; nothing of the body is ever quoted |
| `ota_request_rejected` | a request this endpoint could not read, refused with one of three fixed sentences |
| `onboarding_banner` | where devices are configured, said once at startup |
| `onboarding_key_mismatch` | a request reaches the onboarding path carrying a key-shaped segment that is not this server's; neither is repeated |
| `onboarding_key_unshaped` | the same path, carrying something that is not key-shaped at all |
| `auth_rejected` | a handshake is refused before the accept; no device, since nothing is authenticated yet and the Device-Id header is whatever the caller sent |
| `session_rejected` | a device is turned away, either by the endpoint before a session can run (`vinga_server.ws`) or by the session after the accept (`vinga_server.session`) |
| `session_open` | a conversation starts |
| `session_limit` | the duration cap fires |
| `session_idle` | the idle timeout hangs up on a realtime session |
| `session_closed` | a conversation ends |
| `speaking_started` | the reply's first audio frame goes out |
| `speaking_finished` | the reply's last audio frame has gone out; with `speaking_started` it bounds the interval the frame pacer actually paces, and a reply that never spoke emits none |
| `frames_dropped` | one second of mic frames the edge's guards discarded before they could be decoded, counted by reason; at DEBUG, and counted whether or not this deployment records anything |
| `turn_started` | a reply attempt begins, stamped with the instant the user stopped speaking; `barge_in` says whether answering it interrupted a reply in flight |
| `reply_finished` | a reply ends, however it ended: exactly one per `turn_started`, with an outcome latched where the end was decided |
| `heard` | an utterance is transcribed. No transcript: what was said is the conversation store's |
| `nothing_heard` | an utterance is transcribed to nothing at all, which is one of the four ways an utterance's ASR stage ends, beside `heard`, `provider_failed` and `transcription_abandoned`; no text field, by type |
| `transcription_abandoned` | a transcription was given up on before it answered, because the reply it belonged to was cancelled with the call still running; deliberately not `provider_failed`, since nothing failed |
| `sentence_synthesized` | one sentence of a reply has finished streaming out of the voice: the provider's latency to its first chunk, and the stream's whole lifetime, which includes playback backpressure. At DEBUG |
| `replied` | a reply finishes |
| `agent_said` | one agent's part of a reply |
| `handover` | `switch_agent` succeeds |
| `conversation_resumed` | a stored conversation is picked up again: how much of it was rebuilt, how much could not be, and whether there was more of it than the budget had room for |
| `milestone_recorded` | a consented recap is stored as a checkpoint on its thread, after the user has heard it |
| `prompt_assembled` | the know-how half of a prompt is assembled and cached, with each block's size by provenance |
| `llm_retry` | the first-token watchdog cancels a stalled generation and retries the round once |
| `llm_round` | a generation call finishes |
| `provider_failed` | an ASR, LLM or TTS call fails; a round whose retry also stalled carries `FirstTokenTimeout` |
| `tool_call` | a tool returns |
| `tool_arguments_coerced` | a call went out with argument types this server corrected, because the model quoted a value its tool declares as a number or a boolean: how many were converted, and never which or to what |
| `sentence_withheld` | a sentence of a reply was shaped like a call to a tool this session offered, so it was dropped rather than spoken: how long it was and which tool it was shaped like, never a byte of it |
| `barge_in` | speech cuts a reply short |
| `barge_in_suppressed` | an interruption is dropped and the reply lives |
| `barge_in_merged` | an interruption merges with the utterance the reply was transcribing |
| `filler_skipped` | the filler timer fired but the user was there first, so no clip played |
| `filler_played` | the reply was slow, so a pre-synthesized filler clip masked the wait (its first frame is the turn's `speaking_started`) |
| `reply_fallback` | a turn said the agent's fixed fallback phrase instead of an answer, and why; `audio` says whether it was heard as well as shown |
| `asr_prompt_echo` | a transcript came back as the ASR prompt and the clip was retried once without it, on what the first request left of `timeout_s` (no session or device: providers serve them all) |
| `mcp_connected` | an MCP entry's connect finishes and its tools are published (no session or device: one entry serves every conversation, and the rest of this block is the same) |
| `mcp_down` | an MCP entry fails to come up, or its connection is given up. `stopped` is the intentional one (a shutdown or a reload) and the only one at INFO |
| `mcp_call_dropped` | a tool call failed and the connection was dropped because of it, always beside an `mcp_down` with `call_failed` |
| `mcp_tool_shadowed` | a published tool is dropped because a more specific entry owns its name |
| `mcp_reload` | a reload of the MCP servers finishes, whether or not the caller is still connected |
| `provider_reaches_loopback` | a provider entry built inside a container names this machine in its endpoint |
| `memory_unreadable` | one scope of an agent's memory could not be read, so it remembers nothing of that scope this round |
| `memory_unwritable` | a change an agent asked for could not be stored, so nothing was changed |
| `memory_cleanup_failed` | the memory of conversations that are gone could not be removed, so the next sweep takes it |
| `filler_disabled` | filler synthesis failed for one agent, so latency masking is off for it |
| `fallback_degraded` | the phrase a failed reply says would not synthesize for one agent, so its failed turns are shown on the display and not spoken |
| `capture_started` | a session is being recorded |
| `capture_declined` | a session is not being recorded, and why |
| `capture_limit` | a recording reaches its per-session ceiling |
| `capture_failed` | a recording stops after a write failed |
| `capture_pruned` | old recordings are removed to stay inside the disk budget |
| `capture_over_budget` | the disk budget is exceeded and nothing more can be pruned |
| `capture_enabled` | capture is on, said once at startup and at WARNING: recording room audio is not something to discover by accident |
| `capture_disabled` | capture is configured but off |
| `conversations_enabled` | the conversation store opens at startup, which means this server is recording what is said to it (no session or device: it is said once, before anything connects) |
| `conversations_dropped` | the store is behind and events for one session are being dropped, said once per session at its first drop; the total lands on that session's row |
| `conversations_failed` | a write to the store failed and its batch was dropped, or a prune could not run |
| `conversations_pruned` | retention deleted the conversations that aged out of the window, and the session records nothing points at any more (at INFO: a policy doing its job) |
| `drain_started` | a shutdown begins draining |
| `drain_finished` | every reply finished speaking |
| `drain_incomplete` | a reply was cut, or a session hung |
| `device_bindings_unreadable` | the configuration database could not be read, so the answer is the served world's and may be older |
| `api_error` | the configuration API failed to handle a request; the class name and nothing else |
| `api_storage_error` | the configuration API met unreadable stored state |

No MCP event names a tool, and none of them can. Half of a published
tool name is whatever the far side called it, sanitizing replaces only
the characters both LLM APIs refuse, and an alphanumeric credential goes
through that untouched, so a server handed one of your own could put it
in the logs you keep by listing a tool under it. Every line about a
single tool therefore says which one by its position in that server's
listing. `vinga-server config mcp-server status` prints the names
themselves, to a terminal, when you ask it.

Every event above is declared: its channel, its level, the sentence it
renders, the arguments that sentence takes and every field it may carry,
with closed sets for the fields that hold a reason token. The reference
this index points at is those declarations rendered, and CI regenerates
it and refuses any difference. The emitters build each emission inside a
guard, so an emission that could not be built costs one line on the
emitter's own channel, naming a fixed label and a fixed code and nothing
about the emission itself; it is dropped rather than written in some
other shape, because a telemetry bug must never cost a reply.

### Watching a deployment as it runs

The table above is what gets written down. The same events are also
readable as they happen, over the configuration API and from wherever
the CLI already reaches, which is what the two moments that used to mean
reading the container's log on the server host are:

```bash
# Wait for the next event of one board, print it and exit: what to run
# after typing a URL into a captive portal.
vinga events tail --device aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff

# Or watch until you stop it, which is the diagnostic reading.
vinga events tail --follow
vinga events tail --follow --session 6f1a2b3c4d5e6f708192a3b4c5d6e7f8
vinga events tail --follow --level warning
```

One line per event: the clock time, the level unless it is `INFO`, the
event's name, and its own fields. Nothing is kept behind the stream, so
it carries what happens while it is open and a reader that reconnects
rejoins the present; what happened before is the conversation record's
to answer. A reader that falls behind loses its oldest events rather
than slowing a conversation down, and is told how many on stderr. The
stream ends when you stop it or when the server shuts down, and an end
you did not ask for is a sentence and exit 1 rather than a quiet
terminal, because nothing reconnects on its own: a tail that rejoined
across a gap would look continuous while missing what happened in it.

The same route is `GET /api/runtime/events`, behind the same bearer
token, answering `text/event-stream`.

These events are metadata, and metadata only. What was said is in the
conversation store, keyed by the same `session`: query `turns` there for
the transcript and the reply, and `tool_invocations` for what a tool was
asked and what it answered. Filtering the logs for it no longer works,
and that is the point (see the [content and telemetry
ADR](../docs/adr/2026-08-15-content-and-telemetry-are-separate-surfaces.md)):
a surface with no free-text field cannot leak one. What the events keep
is what a latency brief reads, which is every duration, every count and
every identifier they ever carried. Tokens are never logged, at any
level.

## Capturing a session

**This records room audio to disk.** It is off by default and off until
`enabled` says otherwise, and a warning at startup plus one line per
recorded session say when it is on. Turn it off again once the
recording has been taken.

```yaml
server:
  capture:
    enabled: false
    dir: /data/captures
    # stop capturing a session after this long
    max_session_s: 900
    # budget for the directory, oldest captures pruned first
    max_total_mb: 2000
    # refuse to start a capture below this much free space
    min_free_mb: 1000
```

The flag is the switch, rather than the presence of the section, so
turning capture off again does not mean deleting the directory and the
budgets along with it: the field workflow is to record, then stop, and
the tuning is worth keeping across that. `dir` is required even while
disabled, so switching on is one word rather than one word and
remembering where it writes. A section that is present but off says so
once at startup, because a configured capture that records nothing is
otherwise a silence to debug.

Because it is one flag, the env layer can do the flip on its own:
`VINGA_SERVER__CAPTURE__ENABLED=true` turns it on for one run without
editing the config the deployment mounts, and dropping the variable
turns it off again. That is usually the least disruptive way to take a
field recording.

It exists because acoustic problems cannot be reproduced in any test
lane. The unit lane feeds synthetic frames and the integration lane
drives a simulator, and both bypass the microphone, the board's echo
cancellation, and the room. Whether a reply interrupts itself turns on
how much of the assistant's own voice survives the board's cancellation
and reaches the endpointer, and no test can tell you that number.

Three files per session, sharing one timeline:

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `<session>.wav` | Stereo 16 kHz s16le. Channel 0 is the microphone as decoded, channel 1 is what was paced out to the speaker. |
| `<session>.jsonl` | Every structured event, plus a `t_ms` offset into the audio, plus dropped frames per second and the endpointer's opinion per frame. |
| `<session>.json` | What the capture was made against: server revision, the firmware the device reported, the resolved providers verbatim, and the barge-in thresholds. |

Stereo rather than two files is the whole point: sample N in both
channels is the same instant, so echo leakage is a measurement (cross
correlate the channels and read off gain and delay) rather than a
guess, and the overlap is directly audible in any audio editor. A
channel that goes quiet is filled with silence rather than compressed,
so nothing slides against the events.

The microphone is captured before the session's own guards, so the
frames a configuration discards (not listening, or `barge_in: false`
during a reply) are in the file anyway. Those are the frames that
explain a misfire.

Storage is 64 kB/s, so a fifteen minute session is about 58 MB and the
2000 MB budget is around nine hours. Both bounds matter: the model
caches share the volume and grow underneath the budget, so capture
declines to start and says why rather than being the thing that fills
the disk.

A capture cut off by a restart stays readable. The WAV header carries
byte counts that are only patched on a clean close, so a truncated file
claims zero length, but everything after the 44 byte header is raw
interleaved PCM and the manifest's `complete: false` says the length has
to come from the file size. Both files are flushed as they are written,
so what is lost is at most the last fraction of a second.

In the field: turn it on, hold sessions in the conditions that actually
break things, and say a marker phrase aloud when something goes wrong.
It is on the WAV, and the `heard` event beside it in the decision track
points at the interesting twenty seconds instead of ten minutes of
scrubbing; with the conversation store on and `text: true`, the phrase
itself is one query away, since both records carry the same session id. Copy the three files off
after each session; a field recording is not repeatable.

## The conversation store

**This keeps what was said in a database.** It is off by default and off
until `enabled` says otherwise, and a warning at startup says when it is
on. It names nothing further: which database a server records into is
its own configuration's answer, given once, rather than a line per
start, and a connection is not a thing a log line may carry.

```yaml
server:
  conversations:
    enabled: false
    # store the structured events and every measured number
    telemetry: true
    # store conversation text, and tool names, arguments and results
    text: true
    # prune conversations inactive for longer than this; 0 keeps
    # everything
    retention_days: 90
    # find and resume a past conversation by describing it out loud
    resumption: false
    # how much of a resumed conversation is rebuilt into the model's
    # context, in tokens
    resumption_budget_tokens: 6000
```

What lands is the `record` schema of the same database the
domain half's `domain` schema is in, which means the same instance, the
same credentials and the same backup: one row per session (device,
agents, protocol, the resolved providers, when it opened, when and why
it closed), one row per conversation (its agent, the device it began
on, a title taken from the earliest utterance stored on it, and when it
was last spoken to), one row per turn (what was heard and what was replied, the ASR,
LLM and TTS timings, the rounds and the token counts), one row per tool
call a turn made (its source, its arguments and its result), and one
row per structured event, which is the same decision track the capture
writes beside its audio. A turn names both the session it was spoken in
and the conversation it belongs to, so the two are views of one set of
rows rather than two records: one session can touch several
conversations, and one conversation can span several sessions. Audio never enters it: the capture is the recording,
this is the queryable record. The columns are documented in
[`../docs/reference/conversations-schema.md`](../docs/reference/conversations-schema.md),
generated from the schema itself, and `vinga-server conversations
schema` prints the same document.

The section's absence, and `enabled: false`, both mean the same thing:
no writer is started and no row is ever written. The tables are still
brought up to the current schema at every start, because empty tables
are not a recording and switching recording off does not make what was
already recorded unreadable.

The two switches under the flag are independent, and all four
combinations are supported configurations:

| `telemetry` | `text` | What a session keeps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| on | on | everything: the events, every measured number, and what was said |
| on | off | the events and the numbers; the text columns, tool names, arguments and results are null |
| off | on | what was said, with no events rows and the numbers null: the transparency-first setting |
| off | off | the session spine and the shape of each turn, and nothing else |

Session and conversation rows land in every enabled configuration,
because retention and every read key on them, and their timestamps
survive both switches for the same reason. A conversation's title is
the exception and is content, because it is what somebody said: with
`text: false` a thread has no title. Each session row also records which way the switches
were set for it, so a null column is distinguishable from a column that
was never stored.

**`resumption` is the third switch and the only one that is not about
storage.** It decides whether an agent can find one of its own past
conversations and carry on with it, and it is off by default, because
recording a conversation and reading it back to a model are separate
decisions. It reads what the other two wrote, so a configuration that
asks for it with `enabled` or `text` off is refused at boot in a
sentence naming both keys and both ways out. What it changes, once on:
the two conversation tools above stop refusing, and picking a
conversation rebuilds the model's context from the stored dialogue,
newest turns first, up to `resumption_budget_tokens`. That budget is
approximate by design (the count is estimated from the stored
characters), what it drops when a thread is longer than it are whole
turns oldest first, and a thread rebuilt from its tail is told so, as
is one whose record has holes in it. Arguments and results of the tools
a turn ran stay in the store: what a rebuilt conversation carries is
what was said, and the names of the tools that ran.

A thread longer than that budget is not silently trimmed. The tool
answers with the choice instead, for the agent to put to the user: a
short recap of the whole of it, or carrying on from the recent part.
Carrying on from the recent part is the paragraph above and stores
nothing. A recap is the agent summarizing the thread once, against its
own model, and speaking that summary out loud; only when the user has
heard it to the end is it stored, as a checkpoint on the conversation,
and every later resume is rebuilt from that checkpoint plus what was
said after it. A recap cut off by an interruption, a voice that failed
or a device that went away is not stored at all, and the next resume
offers the same choice again; so is one the model could not produce,
and the thread is picked up from its recent part with the agent told
why. Recap text is conversation content like the dialogue it
summarizes: it lives under the `text` switch, is served by the API, and
is retained and deleted with its thread.

Off, nothing about a conversation's behaviour changes at all: an
agent's working context is assembled inside one session and ends when
the session closes, which is what this server always did.

**The switches are deployment-wide, and they are the only privacy
control this release has.** Until per-user controls exist, enabling text
storage on a device a household shares stores what guests say to it,
which is the same statement the capture section makes about audio.
Attributing a session on a shared device to one member needs voiceprint
identification, which does not exist here yet, so the units deletion is
expressed in are the conversation and the session: the first is what
retention takes whole, and both are what the erasure API will address.
Erasing either on demand is an act of the API with a CLI verb in
front of it, which the deletion section below says in full. The session id is surfaced everywhere regardless: on the
events, on the capture triplet's filenames, and on every row the store
keeps.

Retention is 90 days by default, and what the window is measured
against is a conversation's last activity, because the conversation is
the unit this store retains. A thread inactive for longer than the
window is deleted whole, with its turns; the events of a session older
than the window go on the session's own age, whether or not its row
survives; and a session row goes once no turn names it any more, so a
session that began before the cutoff while its thread is still being
talked to keeps the row those turns cross-reference. The pass runs at
startup and at each session close, and a line says how many
conversations and how many session records went. `retention_days: 0`
keeps everything, which is a deliberate choice rather than a default,
because a store with no policy retains forever. In a deployment that
never resumes a conversation this is the behaviour it always had: a
thread never spans sessions there, so its age and its session's
coincide.

**Deleting on demand is an act of the API.** `DELETE
/api/sessions/{session}` erases one named session; `DELETE
/api/sessions` with at least one of `?session=`, `?device=` and
`?before=` (combined with AND, the day strict) is the purge, answering
how many of everything it took; `DELETE
/api/conversations/{conversation}` erases one named thread out of
every session it touched, leaving session rows and events alone. In
front of them stand `vinga session delete`, `vinga session purge` and
`vinga conversation delete`, each confirming at a terminal and taking
`--force`. Erasure outranks every copy the store derived, not only the
rows named: a thread whose title came from an erased turn is renamed
from its earliest surviving turn or loses its title, recap checkpoints
that summarized an erased turn go along with everything descended from
them, the activity stamp falls back to what the survivors support, and
a thread left with no turns is deleted whole, because a title and two
timestamps are not a conversation.

A session that is still running when its row goes stops being
recorded: the writer finds the row gone and stops writing for that
session, so what is said afterwards is not recorded. Capture files are a
separate instrument and are never touched by any of this; the session id
is the correlation key for whoever needs to remove the matching triplet.

What deletion means is worth stating exactly, because the database
server decides it rather than this one. A deleted row is invisible to
every transaction that begins after the deletion commits, the
read-only `vinga_ro` role's included. A repeatable-read transaction
that was already in flight when it committed keeps seeing the row
until that transaction ends, which is what multi-version concurrency
is and not something this server can prevent: a query left open in a
terminal is one such transaction. Reclaiming the space the row
occupied is the instance's own storage maintenance (autovacuum), not a
per-delete overwrite, so the interval between the delete and the
reclamation is yours to tune rather than this server's to promise.
There is no write-ahead log to truncate here and no sidecar file to
take with it, and copies that have already left the database (a
`pg_dump`, a filesystem snapshot, a replica) are yours to manage.

**Read it live, as `vinga_ro`.** There is nothing to copy first, and
nothing to copy safely: the store is SQL, and the way in is a
read-only session as the role
[`../deploy/postgres-init.sql`](../deploy/postgres-init.sql)
provisions. It has `SELECT` on every table in the `record`
schema, now and after the next migration, and nothing at all on the two
schemas beside it: `domain`, where the stored secrets' ciphertexts
live, and `memory`, whose read surface is the addressed API under
[Tools](#tools) rather than raw tables:

```bash
psql "postgresql://vinga_ro@127.0.0.1:5432/vinga" \
  -c 'select * from record.turns order by id desc limit 20'
```

Its password under compose is `vinga_ro`, which is a loopback-only
convenience in the same way the server's own default password is. The
role also carries a `statement_timeout` and an
`idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`, which are not tidiness: a
reader's locks hold off the schema changes a migration makes, so a
session left open inside a transaction is what would make the next
boot's migration wait out its lock timeout and refuse. A database
provisioned without that file simply has no analyst role, and serves
exactly the same.

There is deliberately no analysis command, and the ids on `sessions`,
`conversations`, `turns` and `events` are identity columns a sequence
never hands out twice, so a client that has read up to one can ask for what came after
it and cannot be handed a different row under the same number.

Writing never happens on the conversation's path. One background thread
does every database call behind a queue nothing on the session loop ever
waits on, and it commits at turn boundaries and at session close, so a
page opened mid conversation reads everything up to the last completed
turn. A database that is wedged or locked drops events, says so once per
session, and records the count on the session row, and it never delays a
reply.

Turns and closes are never refused at the queue, whatever the backlog:
they are the record's structural truth and they arrive at conversational
pace. That is not a promise that a close always lands. A close whose own
transaction fails leaves the session row open-shaped, with a null
`closed_at` and no close reason, which is the same incomplete state a
process killed mid-session leaves behind: it is readable, it is listed,
and retention prunes it on `started_at` like any other. A line at
warning level says so when it happens.

## Which build is running

`version` is the package version and has read `0.1.0` since the package
skeleton. `revision` is which build of it, and it is the field that
distinguishes one deploy from another.

```console
$ curl -s localhost:8003/healthz
{"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0","revision":"a1b2c3d"}
```

**A running pod's revision equals its image tag's suffix**: a container
from the image tagged `sha-9fd3de5` reports `9fd3de5`, so a post-deploy
check is an equality check. CI passes the same seven characters
`docker/metadata-action` puts in the tag, computed from one expression,
so the two cannot drift. It used to pass the full 40-character SHA,
which made the match a prefix check; a deployment scripted it as
equality, which is the natural reading, and got a false failure.

It also rides every `session_open` event, which is the widest payoff for
one field: the JSON logs already ship to a collector, so every session is
attributable to a build rather than only the ones somebody thought to
investigate. Two field recordings that behaved differently are otherwise
indistinguishable from one code change and two different rooms. The OTA
reply carries it too, under `server`, which is the one place a device is
told what it is about to talk to.

The value is resolved once at startup, in this order:

1. `VINGA_REVISION`. The published image bakes in the commit its tags
   are computed from, so `/healthz` and the image's `sha-` tag agree.
2. `git describe --always --dirty`, which covers running from a working
   tree. A tree with uncommitted changes reports `-dirty`, because a
   build running code that is not any commit is exactly when knowing
   matters.
3. `unknown`. An image built with no build argument runs and says it does
   not know; it never fails to start over it.

Building an image yourself:

```console
docker build --build-arg VINGA_REVISION=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) -t vinga-server .
```

## Running in a container

This is the single container and what it needs, which is what a
deployment composes into whatever it already runs. For a trial, the
`docker-compose.yml` at the repository root says all of it once, for
the server and its database together, and the project README's
[Getting Started](../README.md#getting-started) fetches and runs it in
two commands; that file is the trial and development story rather than
the deployment story, and this section is the one home for what a
deployment has to decide.

This section stays that home, and
[`../docs/deployment.md`](../docs/deployment.md) is the worked path
through it: the same contract in a Docker Compose lane and a Kubernetes
lane, against the committed artifacts under
[`../deploy/`](../deploy/).

**Run one replica.** Everything a running server serves from is state
in its process: the pending activation codes new devices show, the
configuration generation an apply swaps in, and the `max_sessions`
count the door enforces. A second replica against the same database
would mint activation codes the first cannot claim, keep serving its
boot-time configuration after an apply lands on the other, and enforce
a separate session cap of its own. The two probes exist so an
orchestrator can manage this one replica's lifecycle (a rollout, a
restart, a drain), not so a balancer can spread devices across
several.

The default image carries both local engines, so one seeded database
serves a conversation. The database itself is the deployment's to
provide, and the server refuses to boot without one it can reach. It
starts on whatever that database holds (nothing, the first time, which
is a valid state to serve), and
the domain half is written into it over the API it is already serving,
with the `vinga` client on whichever machine administers this
deployment. The image ships that same client under the server's own
entry point, so a shell inside the running container is the alternative
where the API is not routed outward: the token and the loopback address
are already in its environment.

**A configuration file is optional.** Every key of the server half has a
default and every one of them is overridable with a `VINGA_`-prefixed
variable, so a container started with nothing mounted at `/config`
serves on those. Mount a YAML there and the image reads it, which is
what a deployment past a handful of keys wants; the two lines after it
write one provider into the domain half and install it:

```bash
docker run -d --name vinga \
  -p 8003:8003 \
  -e VINGA_API_SECRET \
  -e VINGA_AUTH_SECRET \
  -e VINGA_DB_HOST -e VINGA_DB_NAME -e VINGA_DB_USER -e VINGA_DB_PASSWORD \
  -v /path/to/config.yaml:/config/config.yaml:ro \
  -v vinga-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/rafacm/vinga-server:latest

vinga provider set llm claude type=anthropic model=claude-sonnet-5 api_key_env=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
vinga apply
```

An entry that fits on a line is written on one, with no file to name and
no directory to be in. A credential is never one of those arguments:
arguments land in the shell's history and in the process list, which is
why the field above names the variable holding the key rather than the
key.

Past a screenful, the same entry comes from a file instead, and the
commented fragments under [`examples/`](examples/) are what those files
look like. The two spellings write the same entry, and this one is run
from a checkout's `vinga-server/` directory, where the fragment it names
is:

```bash
vinga provider set llm claude -f examples/llm-anthropic.yaml
```

- `/config/config.yaml` is the server half, and mounting it is optional.
  The image's entrypoint names that path when a file is there and names
  nothing when it is not, so an unmounted container boots on the
  defaults and whatever `VINGA_SERVER__*` says. Mount it read-only;
  override any key of it with a `VINGA_`-prefixed environment variable.
  Setting `VINGA_CONFIG` yourself always wins, mounted file or not, and
  a path you name and that is not there is refused rather than ignored.
- `/data` is the volume every engine caches into (`HOME` points there):
  whisper models and Piper voices download at first start and survive a
  new image. Model weights are never baked in.
- The database is not on that volume and not in this container: the
  image sets no database variable at all, and the deployment points
  `VINGA_DB_HOST` and the rest of that family at the Postgres it
  provides. Both schemas are migrated on first open, so there is no
  init command to forget, and a database the server cannot reach is a
  boot that refuses with a sentence rather than a container that waits.
  Give it a restart policy, which is where that decision belongs.
- Logs default to `json` in the image, which is the only default that
  differs from running it directly. Override with
  `VINGA_SERVER__LOG_FORMAT=text`.
- The healthcheck assumes the default port; change `server.port` and
  override `--health-cmd` too.
- A read-only root filesystem works: add `--read-only --tmpfs /tmp` and
  keep the two mounts.
- Stop it with `docker stop -t 30 vinga`, above `drain_s`, so
  conversations in flight finish their sentence.

Behind a TLS-terminating proxy, either set `server.websocket_url`
explicitly or pass the proxy's address in `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`, which
uvicorn honours from the environment.

### The configuration database in a deployment

Eight things a deployment has to get right about it, none of which the
server can decide for you.

**The database is yours to provide, and five variables name it.**
`VINGA_DB_HOST`, `VINGA_DB_PORT`, `VINGA_DB_NAME` and `VINGA_DB_USER`
go wherever the deployment keeps its environment, and
`VINGA_DB_PASSWORD` goes wherever it keeps its secrets, beside
`VINGA_AUTH_SECRET`, `VINGA_API_SECRET` and `VINGA_MASTER_KEY`, since
that is what it is. `VINGA_DB_URL` replaces all five when a
deployment's convention is one connection string, and is a secret for
the same reason: a URL carries a password in its authority and can
carry another in its query. **The shipped default password is `vinga`,
which is a development convenience on an instance bound to loopback
and never anything else**; set a real one before anything reachable
runs on it.

**What the server role needs is ordinary DML and nothing exotic.** No
`CREATEDB`: the server migrates schemas, never databases, so the
database exists before it starts. Run
[`../deploy/postgres-init.sql`](../deploy/postgres-init.sql) against it
once, which creates the `domain`, `record` and `memory` schemas
`WITH AUTHORIZATION` to the server role and provisions the read-only
`vinga_ro` role beside them:

```bash
psql "$ADMIN_URL" -f deploy/postgres-init.sql
```

The executor needs to be able to create roles and to create schemas in
that database (a superuser, or the database's owner with `CREATEROLE`);
the server role needs neither, because it is given schemas it already
owns. Provisioning them any other way works as long as the server role
owns them: `CREATE` on the database does not grant it `CREATE` inside a
schema somebody else owns, which is where Alembic would then fail to
make its tables. Grant the server role `CREATE` on the database
instead, and it creates the schemas itself at first boot. Either
way, **rerun that file after any database reset**: a `dropdb`/`createdb`
takes the schemas and the database-local default privileges with it,
while the instance-level `vinga_ro` role survives, which is why every
statement in the file is written to be run again.

**Rerun it when a release moves the file, too, before starting the new
image.** The upgrade order is always the same: rerun the updated
[`../deploy/postgres-init.sql`](../deploy/postgres-init.sql), then
boot. Every statement in the file is written to be run again, so a
rerun over a database that already has everything is a no-op.

This release moves it, because it adds a third schema, `memory`, where
what an agent was asked to remember is stored. On the privilege
contract above, the server role has no `CREATE` on the database and
cannot make a new schema for itself, so an image started before the
rerun refuses to start with a fixed sentence naming this rerun and
repeating no part of the connection; the rerun is what makes the next
start migrate. Nothing already stored is touched: the two schemas that
are there keep every row, and the new one starts empty. A deployment
whose server role owns its database creates the schema at boot and
does not need the rerun for that, though rerunning is still the
simplest way to be sure the analyst role's grants are what this
release's file says.

**Stop the running server before starting this image.** This release
migrates the memory schema into scopes, and the migration renames a
column `facts` has had since it was created. An older process still
serving while that runs would fail its next memory statement, so the
order is stop, then start, rather than start-then-stop. Nothing else
about the upgrade changes: every fact already stored is carried across
as it stands, under the scope it always had, and the server migrates
the schema at boot as it always does. This is a single-server project
with no rolling upgrade to preserve; a schema change bought with an
expand-and-contract migration would price a property no supported
deployment shape uses.

**What the memory files on disk do next is yours to decide.** Memory
used to be one Markdown file per agent under a `memory:` directory this
server was told about. That section has retired: a configuration file
that still carries it refuses the boot and says so. The files
themselves are left exactly where they are. This release does not read
them, does not import them, and does not delete them; database memory
starts empty, so every agent begins the first conversation after the
upgrade remembering nothing, and each fact is stored again the first
time it is said. Archiving those files, or removing them, is a
deliberate act of yours and nothing here will do it for you.

The release before it moved the file too, by renaming the store's
schema from `conversations` to `record`, and a deployment crossing
that one needs the rerun whether or not its server role owns the
database, because nothing else grants `vinga_ro` `SELECT` on the
renamed schema. The old `conversations` schema is left where it is,
readable beside the new one until somebody drops it; what is in it does
not come across, which
[`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) announces and
[the compatibility record](../docs/adr/2026-08-20-database-upgrades-have-a-compatibility-floor.md)
prices.

**The master key is generated once and escrowed.** Set
`VINGA_MASTER_KEY` wherever the deployment keeps its environment
secrets, alongside `VINGA_AUTH_SECRET`:

```bash
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```

It is only needed once a credential is stored encrypted; a deployment
whose keys are all environment references never needs one. Once
ciphertext exists, losing the key means losing those credentials: the
server refuses to start with a stored secret it cannot open, naming the
entity and the slot. That refusal takes the API with it, so the way back
is the rebuild under [When the server will not
start](#when-the-server-will-not-start): boot on an empty database,
import a kept export, enter the credentials again and apply, which
leaves no unopenable envelope behind. The key
the credentials are then entered under need not be the lost one; what
the next boot needs is a key list that opens every envelope stored, and
after a rebuild every one of them was written under the key in use.

**Rotation adds a key, and this release cannot retire one.**
`VINGA_MASTER_KEY` holds a comma-separated list, newest first;
encryption always uses the newest and decryption tries them in order. A
new key therefore only affects secrets written after it, so every old
key must stay in the list for as long as any token written under it
remains in the database. Re-running `config <kind> secret set` for each stored
secret rewrites it under the newest key, which is the interim path
until a re-encrypt command exists.

**Backups are `pg_dump`, and the server keeps running through one.**
A dump reads inside one transaction with a snapshot of its own, so
what it writes is the database as of the moment it started, whatever
lands afterwards, and there is nothing to stop and nothing to quiesce:

```bash
pg_dump --format=custom --file "/backup/vinga-$(date +%F).dump" \
  "postgresql://vinga@db.internal:5432/vinga"
```

Every schema travels in one dump, because they are one database, and
that now includes what the agents were asked to remember: memory is a
schema rather than a directory, so a dump covers it and there is
nothing beside the database left to back up.
A restore is `pg_restore` into an empty database for the custom format
above (`pg_restore --dbname ...`), or `psql --file` for a plain-text
dump, and it is worth rehearsing on something disposable rather than
first attempting on the day it is needed.

**A restore needs both halves of the secret.** The dump, and every
master key still required to decrypt what it holds, which is why the
keys are escrowed with the deployment's other environment secrets and
separately from the backup itself. A restored database with no key is
a configuration whose credentials will not open.

**What a copy of the database exposes.** No stored plaintext secret:
the encrypted values are ciphertext and the environment references are
variable names rather than values. It does expose the rest of the
domain configuration, which is to say the prompts, the endpoints and
the variable names, and, where recording is on, everything the
conversation record holds. Dumps belong in access-controlled storage,
not in a repository.

**Reading what was said is a `vinga_ro` session, never the server's.**
The instance has no reason to be reachable from anywhere but the
server, so the way in is a port forward for the length of a session,
or a one-shot `psql` beside the database on its own host:

```bash
psql "postgresql://vinga_ro@127.0.0.1:5432/vinga" \
  -c 'select * from record.turns order by id desc limit 20'
```

Always that role, and not the one the server connects as. `vinga_ro`
can read the conversation record and nothing else: the `domain` schema
holds the stored secrets' ciphertexts, and it is not granted there. It
also carries the timeouts that stop a forgotten session from holding a
lock the next boot's migration needs. Give it a real password
(`VINGA_DB_RO_PASSWORD` when the provisioning file is run) for the
same reason the server role gets one; the compose default of
`vinga_ro` is a loopback convenience.

And the operational one, said again because it is the trap of a
configuration a running server is not re-reading on its own: **an edit
is stored and changes nothing until something applies it.** A `config
set` against a running deployment is accepted by that server and is not
in effect when the command returns, which both the command and the API's
answer say every time they write. There are two ways it becomes
effective, and each write says which case it is in: everything in the
domain half, from a provider entry to an agent to the defaults under
them, reaches a running server when it is asked to apply; a device
binding and the default agent reach it at that device's next check-in,
with nothing asked of the server. Renaming an agent is the one write here
that is not an edit of the document: it moves the stored references in
one transaction, its memory and its conversation threads with them, so
nothing is left behind under the old name. What it shares with every
other domain write is the window above, and that window is where the
exception to "nothing left behind" lives: the running server goes on
serving the old name until an apply installs the new one, so a
conversation still in flight remembers under the old name until then,
and `vinga memory list agent` is where such a row shows up.

### The configuration API in a deployment

Four more things, about the surface that writes it. What the API is and
what it serves is under [The configuration API](#the-configuration-api);
this is what a deployment has to decide about it.

**Set `VINGA_API_SECRET` before rolling the image, not after.** The API
is always mounted and always gated, so an image from this release
started without that variable does not come up. It is the one upgrade
step this change forces, and the boot error is the safety net rather
than the plan: it names the variable, prints
`VINGA_API_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)`, and says where the value
goes. Generate one, put it wherever the deployment keeps
`VINGA_AUTH_SECRET` and `VINGA_MASTER_KEY`, and then roll the image.
`server.api.secret_env` renames the variable for a deployment whose
convention is another one.

**Decide what happens to `/api/` at the edge.** It is on the same port
as the device endpoints, because the server is one process, so anything
routing that port outward routes the admin surface with it unless it is
told otherwise. Three answers, in the order they are worth reaching for:

- **Do not route it externally at all.** The device endpoints are the
  only two that need to be reachable from outside, so route
  `/xiaozhi/ota/` and `/xiaozhi/v1/` and let `/api/` be reachable only
  from inside. Configure it by exec into the running container, or by
  forwarding the port to your own machine for the length of a session.
  This is the default worth defending: the surface with the most
  authority is the one nothing outside can address.
- **Route it separately and restrict it**, when a front end or an
  operator genuinely needs it from outside: a route of its own for the
  `/api/` prefix, TLS on it, and whatever source restriction the edge
  can express, so that the bearer token is not the only thing between
  the internet and the configuration.
- Route the port as one thing and rely on the token alone. That is what
  happens by accident, and it is worth choosing deliberately if it is
  what you want, because a token in a client's environment is a token
  in more places than a private address is.

**Loopback or TLS, for the whole API and not only for secret writes.**
The bearer token rides on every request and grants everything the API
can do, a secret set included, so a plain `http://` request to it from
another machine puts the token on the wire in clear. This is a rule the
client enforces rather than recommends: `vinga-server config` refuses a
plain `http://` URL whose host is not a loopback address, with no flag
to override it. The machine's own address on the network is not one of
those, and neither is a name that resolves to loopback: the check reads
the host as written. Reach the API over `https://`, through a tunnel
that terminates TLS, or on loopback from inside the container, which is
the case the default address is built for.

### When the server will not start

A configuration the server refuses to boot on (a stored secret no
configured key opens, an entity that cannot be loaded, a reference that
no longer resolves) leaves nothing to write through, because every
config command is a request to a server that is not answering. The way
back is not a surgical edit: stop the server, delete the database, start
it again on the empty one, import the export taken while the deployment
was healthy, re-enter each stored credential through the `secret set`
commands that export listed at its foot, and apply.

```bash
# Stop the container that will not serve, and take the database away.
# Nothing is connected to it while the server is down, which is what
# lets it be dropped rather than emptied table by table.
docker stop vinga && docker rm vinga
dropdb "$VINGA_DB_NAME" && createdb --owner "$VINGA_DB_USER" "$VINGA_DB_NAME"

# Rerun the provisioning file: dropping the database took the two
# schemas and their default privileges with it, while vinga_ro, which
# is an instance-level role, is still there. The file expects that and
# rotates it rather than failing.
psql "$ADMIN_URL" -f deploy/postgres-init.sql

# Start it again, which boots clean on the empty database, then put the
# configuration back and re-enter the credentials it could not carry.
docker run -d --name vinga ...          # the run command from above
docker exec -i vinga vinga-server config import -f - < deployment.yaml
docker exec -i vinga vinga-server \
  config provider secret set -- llm claude api_key
docker exec vinga vinga-server config apply
```

The import writes and stops, which is the whole of what it does: the
engines the document names are built by the apply on the last line, and
their credentials are the line before it.

**A dropped database takes the conversation record with it**, since
every schema lives in one. What is broken here is the domain half, so a
deployment that is recording and wants to keep what it recorded drops
that half alone, as the server role, and reruns the provisioning file
after it:

```sql
drop schema domain cascade;
```

The rerun is the same either way, and the reason is the same: a
`create schema` is what puts the schema back under the server role's
ownership, and a dropped database also took the default privileges
that let `vinga_ro` read tables the server has not created yet. The
next boot then migrates from nothing, which is the state this
procedure needs and the state a first-ever boot is in.

That is what makes `vinga-server config export` worth keeping in version
control beside the YAML file: it is the document the import takes. A
stored credential never travels in a read, so the export carries the
command that enters each of them rather than the value, and the values
come from wherever the deployment keeps its secrets.

It is a rebuild rather than a repair, and the difference is real: it
puts back what the export says and nothing else, so a row nobody knew
about goes with the schema. A deployment that wants a surgical edit to
the stored rows has one, through ordinary SQL against the `domain`
schema as the server role. That is deliberately not wrapped in this
project's own grammar: a second way in with its own vocabulary is a
second thing to keep honest, and `psql` is already documented by the
people who wrote it.

**Coming from a build that kept its configuration in a local file, it
is the same rebuild with one ordering to get right: export first, then
upgrade.** This build reads Postgres and only Postgres. There is no
driver in it for the old file, no configuration key that would point
at one, and no importer, so an export attempted after the image has
rolled is an export from a server that will not start:

```bash
# With the build you are still running.
docker exec -i vinga vinga-server config export > deployment.yaml

# Then point VINGA_DB_* at an empty database, roll the image, and put
# the configuration back exactly as above: import the document, re-enter
# each stored credential from wherever the deployment keeps its secrets,
# and apply.
docker exec -i vinga vinga-server config import -f - < deployment.yaml
docker exec -i vinga vinga-server \
  config provider secret set -- llm claude api_key
docker exec vinga vinga-server config apply
```

**The conversation record does not come across, and nothing pretends
otherwise.** There is no export format for it and no importer, and
inventing one for a pre-release store was not worth the tool it would
have become. A deployment that wants to keep what it recorded copies
the old `conversations.db` aside before the upgrade and reads it with
`sqlite3`, which is a file it now owns rather than anything this
server will look at again. The same goes for the old `vinga.db` and
for both files' `-wal` and `-shm` sidecars: nothing in this build
touches them, nothing removes them, and they sit on the data volume
until somebody archives or deletes them deliberately.

The full procedure, step by step, is in
[`../docs/reference/cli.md`](../docs/reference/cli.md).

### Choosing an image

Two variants are published, built from one Dockerfile so they cannot
drift. They are the same server; the only difference is which optional
extras are installed.

| Variant | Tags | Carries | Use it when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| default | `latest`, `2026-08-03-1200`, `sha-3f9362a` | both local engines | any config naming `faster_whisper` or `piper`, and anything fully local |
| slim | `slim`, `2026-08-03-1200-slim`, `sha-3f9362a-slim` | neither | ASR and TTS both name external providers |

The default variant is the unsuffixed one, following the convention
that an unqualified tag is the batteries-included image (as in
`python:3.12` against `python:3.12-slim`). Nothing about `latest`
changed when slim arrived.

Slim is 494 MB against the default's 883 MB, a saving of 389 MB, and it
contains no GPL component. The saving is mostly not piper: `faster-whisper`
brings its own inference stack, which is why the reduction is much larger
than the size of the engines themselves.

`silero` VAD is in both. It is a core dependency rather than an optional
extra, it is light, and it runs on every audio frame whichever ASR
provider is configured, so a slim deployment still segments speech
locally.

A slim image given a config that names a local engine refuses to start,
naming the extra it lacks:

```
providers.asr.whisper: type "faster_whisper" needs the faster-whisper
extra; install it with: uv sync --extra faster-whisper
```

That message is written for a source checkout. In a container the answer
is not to install anything but to pull the default variant instead.

Both variants are published for amd64 and arm64, and each has passed the
unit, integration, and smoke lanes: the same whole-conversation smoke
test runs against both.

The moving tag is the only one that moves, `latest` for the default
variant and `slim` for slim, so it is the tag to pull when trying the
server and the wrong one to deploy from. The dated and SHA tags are
never reused: several merges can land on one day, and each gets its own
timestamp, so a rollback names the build it wants.

**Pair the two variants by their SHA tag, not their dated one.** They
are built by separate jobs that finish minutes apart, so one commit can
produce `2026-08-06-1048` and `2026-08-06-1047-slim`. The dated tag is
honest about when each image was built; `sha-<short>` is the one that
says which commit, and it matches across both.

The default image contains `piper-tts` (GPL-3.0) alongside the MIT
server. That is aggregation, not a derived work; the slim variant
contains no GPL component at all. See
[`../THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`](../THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md).

## Onboarding a device

A device running stock xiaozhi firmware knows one thing about its
backend: the OTA URL, held in NVS (namespace `wifi`, key `ota_url`).
Everything else reaches it from the reply to that URL: the WebSocket
URL, its token and protocol version, and the wall clock. So onboarding
a board is two questions: what URL does it get, and which agent does it
talk to.

Both are answered without a cable and without looking up a MAC address.

**1. Ask for the URL to type.**

```bash
vinga-server config ota-url
# http://192.168.1.10:8003/x/AB2C4D5E/
```

The command contacts nothing: it reads the same config file the server
reads and derives the same key from the same device-auth secret, so it
answers before the first start and while a board waits on a bench. On
stderr it says where the origin came from, and an origin nobody
configured reads as the guess it is: set `server.public_url` to name the
deployment exactly.

There are two places the URL is printed and this is the offline one.
The other is `vinga info`, which reads it back over the configuration
API and is what a deployment administered from somewhere other than its
own host uses; both derive it the same way, because there is one
derivation. The running server's startup line is deliberately neither:
it names the origin and points here rather than repeating the URL, since
a log line is kept, shipped and read by everyone who can read logs. A
GET of the endpoint repeats it only to whoever already reached it. The
key stands in front of the endpoint that issues device tokens, which is
what all three of those sentences are about.

The two inputs are the file and the secret, so it runs wherever both
are. Inside the container they already are:

```bash
docker exec -i vinga vinga-server config ota-url
```

In a checkout they are too, and that is the other place it runs:

```bash
uv run vinga-server config --config ./config.yaml ota-url
```

Those are the two, and the list is shorter than it used to be. This
command used to be reachable through `uvx --from git+...` as well, and
it is not any more: the default install of this package is the
configuration CLI, and this derivation reads the onboarding package,
which is the server half. On that install the command is in the grammar
and answers one sentence saying which half is missing. It is a
server-host command by nature, since the file half it reads is the one a
workstation does not have, and the question a workstation actually has
about a URL, whether anything answers on it, is `vinga-server doctor`'s.

Eight characters, in an alphabet with no `0`/`O` and no `1`/`I`/`l`,
because this string gets typed on a phone keyboard off a small display.
It is derived rather than stored, so it survives restarts and changes
only when the device-auth secret does.

**2. Check what answers there**, before typing it into anything:

```bash
vinga-server doctor
# http://192.168.1.10:8003/x/AB2C4D5E/ is vinga-server 0.1.0, and sends
# devices to ws://192.168.1.10:8003/xiaozhi/v1/ (protocol version 1).
```

With no argument it checks the URL above; give it one to check any
other. It is a GET and never a POST, so it mints nothing, and it
reports what a device would be told: nothing answers there, something
other than vinga-server answers, vinga-server answers but sends
devices to a plain `ws://` URL from behind TLS (see
[Behind a reverse proxy](#behind-a-reverse-proxy)), or it is healthy.
Healthy exits 0 and the rest exit 1.

**3. Type it into the board's captive portal.** A board with no Wi-Fi
provisioning brings up its own access point; join it, and the portal
offers the network form plus an advanced section holding the server
address. Put the URL there. Which button starts that portal and what
the board shows while it waits are per-board facts, and they are in
[`../docs/devices/`](../docs/devices/README.md).

A portal that saves the address without its trailing slash is fine:
every device-facing route answers both spellings itself, and none of
them redirects, because the firmware does not follow a redirect on
these requests.

**4. Read the six digits off the board, if it shows any.** A device the
configuration resolves to no agent is answered with an activation code
instead of a token: the firmware shows it and speaks it, and re-checks
every half minute to two minutes, so the number on the screen is always
the current one. A board a `default_agent` already covers shows no code
and connects straight away, which is the case just below.
`vinga-server config device pending list` lists every board waiting, with the board
type and firmware version each one reported, which is how two boards on
one desk are told apart.

**5. Bind it, by the code rather than by the MAC:**

```bash
vinga-server config device pending claim 418293 assistant
# wrote device aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff bound to assistant
```

The device polls every three seconds while it waits, so it connects
seconds later with no restart and no power cycle. `device bind` is the
same write for a MAC you already know; `device pending claim` is for the
board in front of you.

**Which devices are offered a code.** Exactly those the database
resolves to nothing: no binding row of their own, and no
`default_agent` set. A deployment with a default agent covers every
unknown board by design, so its devices are handed a token straight
away and never see a code, which is also why nothing changes for a
deployment that upgraded into this. Turning `server.onboarding.enabled`
off removes both the short URL and the code ceremony.

**On a fresh deployment, write the agent and apply it.** A server
serves the world it last installed, so an agent written into an empty
database is not being served yet: bind a board to it and the
acknowledgement says which command installs it rather than promising
otherwise. `vinga-server config apply` is that command, and from there
the board connects at its next check-in, seconds later; no step of a
deployment's life needs a restart once the process is up.

**Already-provisioned boards keep working.** A board carrying a full
`ota_url` in NVS reaches `server.ota_path` exactly as before, and both
routes serve the same endpoint. Rewriting NVS wipes a board's Wi-Fi
provisioning, so there is no need to move a fleet at all; a board that
is being reprovisioned anyway can be given the short URL instead. Once
no board needs it, `ota_path: null` unmounts the legacy route and
leaves one way in.

**A rotated device-auth secret changes the key**, because the key is
derived from it. Boards already connected do not care: they hold their
own full URL. What needs the old key is a board being onboarded through
the URL somebody wrote down before the rotation, and
`server.onboarding.key` pins it for exactly that. A wrong key answers
404, byte for byte what a path that was never served answers, while
logging the attempted key beside the correct one, so a typo and a
rotation both diagnose themselves in the server's own log.

**The WebSocket URL** is derived from the address the device reached
the OTA endpoint on, so a LAN deployment needs no extra configuration.
Set `server.websocket_url` when the server sits behind a proxy or a
name the request headers do not carry.

vinga-server serves no firmware images: the reply always tells the
device it is up to date.

The ceremony above has been driven end to end against a simulated
device and a served server, and validated on hardware on 2026-08-13, on
both of the boards available: the Waveshare factory AMOLED-2.16
onboarded from its portal with no cable, and the stock-firmware
Touch-LCD-1.54 pointed at the same server over USB-written NVS. That is
what turns "the firmware shows the code" from a reading of upstream's
sources into an observation, and the evidence is recorded with the
ceremony in
[`../docs/xiaozhi-notes.md`](../docs/xiaozhi-notes.md#activation-the-6-digit-code-ceremony).
The serial procedures a board needs, writing its NVS and reading it
back, are in
[`../docs/devices/README.md`](../docs/devices/README.md#writing-the-servers-address-into-nvs).

## Transports

**WebSocket only.** The device speaks Opus over one WebSocket, and that is
the only transport vinga-server implements or plans for v1.

Upstream supports a second one, **MQTT plus UDP**: the OTA reply carries an
`mqtt` section instead of a `websocket` one, control messages go over MQTT
and audio over a separate UDP stream. vinga-server never sends an `mqtt`
section, so devices always take the WebSocket path. Supporting it later is
additive and needs no change to what exists: the OTA endpoint would choose
which section to send per device.

**WebRTC is not an upstream transport.** The only WebRTC reference upstream
is the WebRTC/NSNet noise-suppression algorithm in the device's audio front
end (and it ships disabled). A WebRTC transport would be new work on both
sides, not adoption of something the firmware already speaks.

## Ports and topology

Both endpoints share one port (`server.port`, default 8003), because
vinga-server is a single ASGI app. Upstream splits them across two (HTTP
8003, WebSocket 8000).

The advertised WebSocket URL is deliberately independent of the listening
topology, which is what keeps this from being a one-way door: whatever the
process listens on, `server.websocket_url` decides what devices are told to
connect to.

What one port buys:

- A LAN deployment needs no configuration at all. The WebSocket URL is
  derived from the address the device reached the OTA endpoint on. With two
  ports that is impossible, since the request tells you the HTTP port and not
  the other one.
- One firewall rule, one container port, one certificate, one route.

What it costs:

- No separation at the network layer. Exposing one endpoint and not the
  other, or giving them different idle timeouts, has to be done by path
  rather than by port. This matters in practice: a WebSocket carrying a
  conversation needs a long idle timeout, an OTA check wants a short one.
- No independent scaling or lifecycle. WebSocket connections are long-lived
  and stateful while OTA requests are short and stateless, but they share a
  process, so they share a worker pool, a restart, and a crash.

### Behind a reverse proxy

One port and two paths means a proxy in front has to treat those paths
differently. Four things to get right:

- **Set `server.websocket_url` explicitly, or trust the proxy.** The
  derived URL is wrong behind a proxy that terminates TLS: uvicorn only
  trusts `X-Forwarded-Proto` from `forwarded_allow_ips`, which defaults to
  `127.0.0.1` and so will not match the proxy's address. The reply then
  says `ws://` where it should say `wss://`, and devices fail to connect
  with nothing obviously misconfigured. Either name the URL yourself, or
  put the proxy's address in the `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` environment
  variable, which uvicorn reads when the setting is not passed. There is
  no config key for it: `server.websocket_url` is the explicit answer, and
  the environment variable covers the rest without a second way to say the
  same thing. `vinga-server doctor` is what says this has
  happened: it names a `ws://` websocket URL behind an `https://` OTA
  URL as the fault it is, rather than leaving a board failing at the
  handshake with every other line looking right.
- **Set `server.public_url` too.** TLS ends at the proxy, so nothing a
  request carries says what a person should type; without it the
  onboarding URL is derived from `server.websocket_url`, and failing
  that from the address the request reached the OTA endpoint on, which
  behind a proxy is the address the proxy used rather than the one a
  person has. The startup line has no request to read at all and
  guesses from the listen address, saying that it is a guess.
- **One idle timeout is enough, above 20 seconds.** The server pings every
  connected device every 20 seconds, so a conversation WebSocket is never
  actually idle even when nobody is speaking. A proxy therefore needs only
  a read timeout above that interval, and the two paths need no different
  treatment.
- **Allow the upgrade and turn off response buffering** on the WebSocket
  path. A proxy that buffers, or that does not pass `Upgrade` and
  `Connection` through, either breaks the handshake or adds latency to every
  spoken reply.
- **Restarts end conversations.** Every open WebSocket dies with the
  process, and the OTA endpoint shares that process, so neither can be
  restarted without the other. The server drains on SIGTERM (see
  [Limits](#limits)); give whatever stops it a grace period above
  `drain_s`.

Separating the two later needs no separate ports and no code change: run the
same image twice, route `/xiaozhi/ota/` to one group and `/xiaozhi/v1/` to
the other, and point `server.websocket_url` at the second. Devices follow,
because they are told where to go.

## Status

vinga-server serves conversations end to end: OTA and WebSocket
endpoints, the VAD/ASR/LLM/TTS pipeline on pluggable providers, agents
bound to devices, MCP tools on both sides, device authentication,
onboarding by a short URL and an activation code, limits,
structured logging, and a published multi-arch container image. The v1
plan and its per-milestone implementation notes live in
[`docs/plans/`](../docs/plans/); getting a device on your desk onto it
is in [`../docs/devices/`](../docs/devices/README.md), and the wire it
speaks is in [`../docs/xiaozhi-notes.md`](../docs/xiaozhi-notes.md).
