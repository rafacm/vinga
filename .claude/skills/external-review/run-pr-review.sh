# Self-posting PR review: runs the review backend against a PR's diff
# from inside the PR's worktree, then posts the result as a comment with
# a provenance header, so the review lands even if the driving session
# dies between the review finishing and the comment being posted.
#
# Usage:
#   run-pr-review.sh <worktree> <base-ref> <pr-number> "<pr-title>" "<context sentence>"
#
# REVIEW_BACKEND selects the reviewer CLI: codex (default) or claude,
# the fallback for when the codex quota is exhausted. REVIEW_MODEL
# selects the model within the backend (default gpt-5.6-sol for codex,
# claude-opus-5 for claude). The tiering rule lives in SKILL.md: sol
# for plans and behavior-changing milestone PRs, terra for low-stakes
# rounds. REVIEW_EFFORT pins the reasoning effort (default high) in
# the backend's own vocabulary, and the provenance header records
# the run as `<provider>/<model>, thinking <level>`, the attribution
# string the implement-issue skill defines.
#
# Writes its working files (diff, prompt, output, posted comment) next
# to nothing in the repository: they go to $TMPDIR (or /tmp).
