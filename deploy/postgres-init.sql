-- Provision one vinga database: the three schemas, `domain` for the
-- configuration, `record` for what was said and `memory` for what each
-- agent was asked to remember, and the read-only role an analyst
-- queries the conversation record through.
--
-- One file, run in two places. The compose service mounts it into
-- /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d, where Postgres executes it once as the
-- superuser when the data directory is initialized; an infra repository
-- runs the same bytes by hand against its own instance, taking the
-- connection from a libpq service and the password from ~/.pgpass so
-- that neither is ever a command-line argument:
--
--     PGSERVICE=vinga-admin psql -f deploy/postgres-init.sql
--
-- What the executor needs is the right to create roles and to create
-- schemas in that database: a superuser, or the database's owner with
-- CREATEROLE. What the server role needs afterwards is nothing beyond
-- ordinary DML on its own schemas, which is why the schemas below are
-- created WITH AUTHORIZATION to it: the executor owns what it creates,
-- and CREATE on the database does not grant the server role CREATE on a
-- schema somebody else owns, which would leave Alembic unable to make
-- its own tables.
--
-- Repeatable by construction, because the documented reset is a
-- dropdb/createdb: that destroys the schemas and the database-local
-- default privileges while the instance-level vinga_ro survives, so the
-- role is create-or-rotate and every grant is written to be run again.
-- Rerun this file after any database reset.
--
-- Rerun it when a release moves the file, too, before starting the new
-- image. A release that adds a schema is exactly that case: the server
-- role deliberately has no CREATE on the database, so it cannot make a
-- new schema for itself, and an image started before the rerun refuses
-- to start with a fixed sentence naming this file.
--
-- Nothing here is a migration. The tables inside the three schemas are
-- Alembic's, created by the server on its first boot against a fresh
-- database; a database provisioned without this file simply has no
-- analyst role, and migrates and serves exactly the same.
