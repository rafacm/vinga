## Notes on other components

- Wake-word models (ESP-SR) are licensed by Espressif for use on Espressif
  chips.
- ASR/VAD model weights (e.g. SenseVoiceSmall, Silero VAD) are downloaded at
  deploy time and carry their own licenses; they are not redistributed here.
- The `edge-tts` Python package is GPL-3.0; Vinga treats TTS engines as
  optional pluggable providers so that the core server does not depend on it.

## The published container image

`ghcr.io/rafacm/vinga-server` is published in two variants. The
**default** one (unsuffixed tags) bundles vinga-server with both of its
optional local engines, so that one `docker run` serves a conversation
without a cloud account. Everything in this section describes that
variant. The **slim** one (`-slim` tags) installs neither local engine
(only the `otel` and `langfuse` extras beside the `serve` tier every
image carries), and so contains neither of the copyleft components below
except PyAV, which the `serve` tier brings in.

Two of the default variant's contents carry copyleft terms:

- **piper-tts** (piper1-gpl) is **GPL-3.0**. It is installed in the
  default image as an independent, unmodified package that
  vinga-server calls through
  its ordinary Python API; the two are aggregated on one filesystem, not
  combined into a derived work. vinga-server itself remains MIT and does
  not depend on piper outside the optional `piper` extra. Corresponding
  source for piper-tts is available from
  <https://github.com/OHF-voice/piper1-gpl>.
- **PyAV** ships a bundled FFmpeg build, most of which is **LGPL-2.1 or
  later**. It is likewise installed unmodified and dynamically linked, and
  its source is available from <https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV> and
  <https://ffmpeg.org>.

Model weights are never included in the image. Whisper models and Piper
voices download at first start into the mounted `/data` volume, under
their own licenses.

An image without the GPL engine is a reasonable thing to want, and the
`slim` variant is it: no local engine extras, so no piper-tts and no
GPL-3.0 component. PyAV and its bundled FFmpeg remain, being a
dependency of the `serve` tier that every image installs.
